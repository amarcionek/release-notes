<h1>What's new in dCache 5.1<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

The 5.1 series of dCache focuses on new data transfer features.

It introduces 3rd-party copy capabilities to the xrootd protocol. 

FTP doors can now be accessed using anonymous FTP, and encrypted FTPS (TLS) authentication is now supported as well.

gPlazma has gained support for SciToken authentication as well as improved OpenID Connect support.

Pools can now send the full set of inotify events through SSE.

Pool manager can create dynamic pool groups based on defined tags.



## Incompatibilities

  * The Kafka configuration was moved from dcache.properties to a dedicated kafka.properties file.


## Acknowledgments

Once again, we are grateful for code and documentation contributions from contributors outside of our core team.

Onno Zweers provided many helpful corrections to the documentation.

Lea Morschel also provided documentation and code refinements.

Other contributions originated from a lecture at HTW Berlin; many thanks to Jonas Grabber, "tabea" and "xpinkyx" for their contributions.

### Pool Manager

Added option `-dynamic` to `psu create pool` command to create a pool group that will dynamically add all pools
that have a specific attribute. Currently, only pool tag, defined by `pool.tags` property is supported.

Example:
```
>  psu create pgroup -dynamic -tags=zone=A zone-A-pools
```

Will create pool group `zone-A-pools` and any existing pool as well as any new pool that configured with tag
`zone=A` will be automatically included into that pool group.

### Resilience

An important bug (from a race condition) which made resilience susceptible to causing data loss during removal of excess replicas
was fixed.

Several smaller bug fixes were also applied:

1) The restart command

```
\s Resilience pool ctrl start
```

now properly reinitializes the pool state on the pool operations.

2) The retry command

```
\s Resilience retry errors
```

no longer throws a string index exception.

3.  After excluding a pool, it cannot be scanned under any circumstances; it must be explicitly included
again before scanning can be activated on it; i.e.,

```
\s Resilience pool include [pool expression]
```

Access logging has also been added to resilience in order to be able to trace its communication with
other dCache components.  As usual, these records appear at INFO level in the ``resilience.access`` log.

For clarity, the final state of a file operation which ends up being unnecessary is no longer reported
as 'VOID', but as 'NOOP', when you do:

```
\s Resilience file ls
```
