<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

The 5.1 series of dCache focuses on new data transfer features.

It introduces 3rd-party copy capabilities to the xrootd protocol.

FTP doors can now support anonymous-FTP logins, and explicit TLS
encrypted control channel (FTPS).

gPlazma has gained support for SciToken authentication as well as improved OpenID Connect support.

Pools can now send the full set of inotify events through SSE.

Pool manager can create dynamic pool groups based on defined tags.


## Incompatibilities

  * The Kafka configuration was moved from dcache.properties to a dedicated kafka.properties file.

## Acknowledgments

Once again, we are grateful for code and documentation contributions from contributors outside of our core team.

Onno Zweers provided many helpful corrections to the documentation.

Lea Morschel also provided documentation and code refinements.

Other contributions originated from a lecture at HTW Berlin; many thanks to Jonas Grabber, "tabea", "Co" and "xpinkyx" for their contributions.


## Release 5.1.4

### Changes affecting multiple services

This release includes an updated Jetty library, with the update adressing
CVE-2019-10247.

This release includes an updated Jetty library, with the update adressing
CVE-2019-10247.

### dcap

The Kafka messaging implementation in the dcap service has been made more robust,
fixing issue [#4831](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/issues/4831).

### frontend

Periodic activity associated with the frontend door is now logged with the
door's cell name. Such messages will also appear in the door's
pinboard.

### nfs

Periodic activity associated with the NFS door is now logged with the
door's cell name. Such messages will also appear in the door's
pinboard.

### pool

Attempting to start a full checksum scan (with `csm check *`) while an
existing scan is still running is no longer reported as a bug.

Pool start-up logging now includes the corresponding pool cell name.

An internal timing check was updated, which should result in more robust pool
behaviour. There should be no user-visible impact.

### webdav

Periodic activity associated with the WebDAV door is now logged with the
door's cell name. Such messages will also appear in the door's
pinboard.

### xrootd

A new configuration property, `pool.mover.xrootd.tpc-server-response-timeout`, allows
setting a timeout for xrootd 3rd party copy operations. This can also be changed through
the new admin command `xrootd set server response timeout`.

## Release 5.1.2

### alarms

To ease troubleshooting, the POOL_DEAD alarm message now includes the pool name.

### pinmanager

A bug was fixed where PinManager's `bulk ls` admin command yielded a 
NullPointerException if the optional argument was omitted.

A typo prevented the error message "Remote connection failure while unpinning..." from
appearing completely and correctly in the logs. The error message string now contains
the message string of the underlying Exception, hopefully providing helpful details for 
troubleshooting.

### pool

A regression that prevented a replica's last access time from being updated was fixed.

A regression that prevented a replica's position in the LRU queue for garbage collection from being updated was fixed.

inotify's IN_CLOSE_WRITE event was sent at a time when it could not be guaranteed that
the file triggering the event could immediately be opened. This race condition was
fixed, and consumers can start using a file immediately after receiving this event.

### webdav

Users asserting the "admin" role would occasionally receive 
NullPointerExceptions when trying to transfer files through 
WebDAV. This release fixes that issue.

## Release 5.1.0

### Alarms

So that they can be given different priority levels, a new alarm,
``POOL_DEAD``, was created to distinguish a pool which is completely
unreachable, from ``POOL_DOWN`` or ``POOL_DISABLED``.

Alarms was also modified in order to be able to support a more modern
version of the logback library.

### Billing

The database connection was wrapped so as to catch fatal exceptions
and report them as alarms (this is already done for other databases
such as chimera).

When using the Kafka messaging system, the "billing" topic was
hardcoded until now. This release introduces a new configuration
variable, `dcache.kafka.topic=billing` to configure this.

When a pool reports a replica was removed, it includes information on
why the replica was deleted.  By default, this information is logged
at the end of the line in double-quotes, where previously an empty
string was logged.

### dCacheView

Support macaroons for sharing files and directories.  There is now an
easy way for a user to generate a pre-authorised URL by requesting a
macaroon from dCache.

Gravatar is an externally run service that maps an email address to an
icon.  The goal is that many independent services may use the same
icon for the same user.  At sites' request, this behaviour is now
optional.

### Frontend

A bug preventing the proper filtering of active transfers according to
uid was fixed.  A reminder as to how this works: (a) admins always see
everything; (b) authenticated users always see their own transfers;
(c) if ``frontend.authz.unlimited-operation-visibility`` is set to
`true`, authenticated users can see all transfers.  Non-authenticated
users can only see anonymous transfers.

The inotify support now includes sending IN_OPEN, IN_ACCESS,
IN_MODIFY, IN_CLOSE_WRITE, IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE events on file activity.
Uploading or writing a file will send IN_OPEN, IN_MODIFY,
IN_CLOSE_WRITE.  Downloading or reading a file will send the IN_OPEN,
IN_ACCESS, IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE events.  Support in the pool for sending
these events is configurable `pool.inotify-generation.enable` (enabled
by default).  Some fine-tuning is possible using
`pool.inotify-generation.backlog.initial`,
`pool.inotify-generation.backlog.per-door` and
`pool.inotify-generation.message-batch-size` where these have the same
meaning as the similarly named `pnfsmanager.` properties.

Sending IN_MODIFY and IN_ACCESS events is rate-limited by the pool, so
that multiple IO operations of the same type generate at most one
event every `pool.inotify-generation.io-suppression`
`pool.inotify-generation.io-suppression.unit` (by default 10 SECONDS).


### FTP

Add support for anonymous FTP.  Anonymous FTP is when the client
authenticates with a place-holder username (e.g., `anonymous` or
`ftp`) and something (perhaps their email address) as the password.
When enabled, dCache will grant limited (read-only) access to that
user.  Many aspects may be configured, including the username
(`anonymous` by default) and whether the password must look like an
email address (by default not enforced).  A specific root directory
may be configured for anonymous users (by default, dCache's root),
further limiting what data is exposed.  The Globus transfer service
uses anonymous access for "archival" access.

Add support for FTPS doors.  This is explicit FTPS sometimes written
as FTP(E)S.  Implicit FTPS is not widely used and is not supported in
dCache.  This new FTP door is represented by a new possible value for
`ftp.authn.protocol`.  Both FTPS and gsiftp encrypt the control
channel and neither support encrypted data transfers.  FTPS doors are
advertised (in info-provider, frontend, etc) with URLs that start
`ftps://`.  Currently, only username and password authentication is
supported.

### gplazma

The ban plugin can now ban users by their uid or gid.

The restrictions infrastructure now supports a mult-targeted
restriction: `MultiTargetedRestriction`.  This allows a plugin to
allow users to have different permissions for different parts of the
namespace.

#### OpenID-Connect

The oidc plugin will introspect JWT to learn issuer.  The access
token, issued by the OpenID-Connect server is opaque; however, a JWT
is a common choice for this token.  If the token is a JWT then the
oidc plugin can discover which OIDC server issued the token.  If
multiple OIDC servers are configured, knowing which one issued the
token avoids having to contact each OIDC server, resulting in a faster
response.

The oidc plugin now accepts the `gplazma.oidc.http.slow-threshold` and
`gplazma.oidc.http.slow-threshold.unit` configuration properties, with
2 SECONDS as default values.  If looking up a user takes longer than
this threshold then the plugin will log the slow query.

The oidc plugin will cache the OIDC discover document.  This document
contains slowly changing information, so it makes sense to cache the
information.  The cache lifetime is controlled by the configuration
properties `gplazma.oidc.discovery-cache` and
`gplazma.oidc.discovery-cache.unit`, with default values of 1 HOUR.
Fetching an up-to-date version of the discovery document when the
cache has expired is done asynchronously: login attempts will use the
old data until the fresh document is received.

The oidc plugin will now query OIDC servers in parallel, if more than
one OIDC server is configured.

The oidc plugin will try to keep the TCP network connections with OIDC
services (used to query a user's identity) alive between subsequent
requests.

The oidc plugin caches a user's identity, as this lookup operation may
be slow for some OIDC servers.  The maximum number of identities
cached is `gplazma.oidc.access-token-cache.size` (by default 1000).
Cached information is refreshed, controlled by
`gplazma.oidc.access-token-cache.refresh` and
`gplazma.oidc.access-token-cache.refresh.unit` (by default 100
SECONDS).  This refresh happens asynchronously: existing login
activity uses the existing data until new information is returned.
Users are automatically removed from the cache if they are idle.  The
expiry time is controlled by `gplazma.oidc.access-token-cache.expire`
and `gplazma.oidc.access-token-cache.expire.unit` (by default 120
SECONDS).

#### SciToken

Add scitoken plugin to support SciTokens.  A SciToken is a bearer
token from some OAuth2 server that uses the JWT format.  The SciToken
includes a description of which activities the bearer to entitled.
The scitoken plugin maps all tokens from the same OAuth2 server to a
single account.  Paths within the SciToken are mapped to dCache paths
by adding a prefix.  The plugin optionally supports t

The `jti` claim is unique for each SciToken.  dCache can prevent
replay attacks by remembering the previous
`gplazma.scitoken.token-history` values and rejecting the token if
already seen.  If the configuration value is zero (the default) then
this feature is disabled.

The `aud` claim describes which service the SciToken was issued.  The
`gplazma.scitoken.audience-targets` configuration property is a
space-separated list of targets that dCache should consider for
itself.  If the configuration property is non-empty then dCache will
reject any SciToken with an `aud` claim that does not match one of the
listed claims.

### NFS

Improve performance of file system locks.

### Pool

For HTTP transfers, the pool now honours the
`pool.mover.http.chunk-size` property.  Some storage backends (in
particular, CEPH) suffer from very poor performance if IO operations
are small.  Setting this property to a larger value will result in the
pool caching incoming data (in memory) so that writes are the
configured size.  When sending data, the pool will try to read this
amount of data before sending it to the client.

When accepting data, the pool may know the file's ultimate size before
the transfer has started; for example, if an HTTP client specifies
the 'Content-Length' HTTP request header in a PUT or an HTTP TPC
request, or if an FTP upload is orchestrated using SRM.  Under these
circumstances, the the pool will now allocate all of that capacity in
the storage backend before initiating the transfer.  This avoids
allocating more capacity with each client write.  Some storage
backends (CEPH in particular) suffer from poor performance if capacity
is allocated incrementally.

Improve error reporting for HTTP Third-party copy.  In particular, the
error message describes any redirection that took place while removing
redundant information.

When making an HTTP third-party PUSH copy, the pool makes an HTTP PUT
request and then verifies that the uploaded file was transferred
correctly by requesting the uploaded file's checksum.  Previously, the
pool always asked for the same set of checksum algorithms,
irrespective of which algorithm values dCache knows for this file.
dCache now builds the list of desired checksum algorithms based on the
known checksums for the file.

When making an HTTP third-party PUSH copy, the pool checks the HTTP
response status code from the server.  The server may response 204 and
205 to indicate a successful upload where the content is identical, a
status code that some systems (including OneData) use.  dCache now
considers 204 and 205 as successful HTTP response codes.

A successful HTTP PUT request for an HTTP third-party PUSH copy does
not guarantee that a subsequent HTTP HEAD request will succeed.  In
particular, a pre-authorised URL (from an S3 endpoint) may allow the
PUT request but not the HEAD request.  Previously, dCache always
considered this to be a failure and failed the request.  Now, if the
transfer is not required to verify checksums then the HEAD request
failure is ignored.

The NFS mover now tells the client that if it wishes to update file
attributes then such requests must go to the door (not the pool).  A
client calling fsync on an open file will now update the file's mtime
and size.

Support pools with multiple tags.  The `pool.tags` configuration
property was meant as a comma-separated list of key-value pairs; e.g.,
`pool.tags = tag1=value1, tag2=value2, ...`.  Due to a bug, a pool had
only one tag, with the remainder tags included in that tag's value
(e.g., `tag1` `value1,tag2=value2`).  Now pools will accept multiple
tags.

### Pool Manager

Added option `-dynamic` to `psu create pool` command to create a pool
group that will dynamically add all pools that have a specific
attribute. Currently, only pool tag, defined by `pool.tags` property
is supported.

Example:
```
>  psu create pgroup -dynamic -tags=zone=A zone-A-pools
```

Will create pool group `zone-A-pools` and any existing pool as well as
any new pool that configured with tag `zone=A` will be automatically
included into that pool group.

Add the ability to disable anonymous staging.  Without enabling
explicit stage protection, dCache allows anyone who can read a file to
stage it.  Various doors allow anonymous access, where any
world-readable files may be read.  If such a file is stored on tape
then an anonymous user could trigger staging of those files.  This
version of dCache has the ability to disallow staging if the user is
not authenticated.

The `psu` admin commands are inconsistent.  Several commands that
support modifying associations have the form `psu addto` and `psu
removefrom` to add and remove an association (respectively).  However,
the commands for managing the associations between pools or poolgroups
and links do not follow this form; instead, the commands are `psu add
link` and `psu unlink`.  This version of dCache fixes this
inconsistency by also supporting the `psu addto link` and `psu
removefrom link` commands.

The `rc failed` admin command documentation is updated, so it no
longer wrongly described the argument as a PNFS-ID.

### Resilience

An important bug (from a race condition) which made resilience
susceptible to causing data loss during removal of excess replicas was
fixed.

Several smaller bug fixes were also applied:

1) The restart command

```
\s Resilience pool ctrl start
```

now properly reinitializes the pool state on the pool operations.

2) The retry command

```
\s Resilience retry errors
```

no longer throws a string index exception.

3.  After excluding a pool, it cannot be scanned under any
circumstances; it must be explicitly included again before scanning
can be activated on it; i.e.,

```
\s Resilience pool include [pool expression]
```

Logging of messages has also been added to resilience in order to be
able to trace its communication with other dCache components.  These
records appear at INFO level in the ``resilience.resilience`` log.

For clarity, the final state of a file operation which ends up being
unnecessary is no longer reported as 'VOID', but as 'NOOP', when you
do:

```
\s Resilience file ls
```

### WebDAV

The HTTP status code returned after successfully initiating an HTTP
third-party-copy is now 202 (Accepted), rather than 200 (OK).  The
HTTP response also includes a Content-Type header describing the
response as `text/perf-marker-stream`.

HTTP third-party copy now supports RFC-3230 'Want-Digest' headers on
COPY requests.  For HTTP PUSH requests, this just acts like an HTTP
HEAD request with the 'Want-Digest' header: the response includes the
file's checksum.  For HTTP PULL requests, dCache will ensure that the
most appropriate checksum algorithm is calculated.  If the client
advertises it suppers HTTP trailers then the checksum value is
returned after the transfer has completed.

### XRootD

The dCache xrootd door/server now supports security level
configuration and signed hash verification. See ``dcache.properties``
under "Xrootd: support for verifying signed hashes (by server/door)"
for information.

We have also added support for mapping clients with valid credentials
to NOBODY; this also enables the current version of third-party-copy
(which lacks the full proxy delegation that will be available in the
next Golden Release [5.2]) to allow destination servers to log in
anonymously to dCache as source during third-party-copy; in this
latter case (only), dCache also allows the server to see
read-protected files.

A bug involving access logging when the door is configured with
HAproxy was fixed, and trace-level logging in general was converted to
debug-level, so that the former may be reserved for handshake packet
dumps only.

### Changes affecting multiple services

Kafka topics can now be set independently for several services using
the variables

    dcache.kafka.topic = billing

(where "billing" is the default value) and the more specific

    dcap.kafka.topic = ${dcache.kafka.topic}
    ftp.kafka.topic = ${dcache.kafka.topic}
    nfs.kafka.topic = ${dcache.kafka.topic}
    pool.kafka.topic = ${dcache.kafka.topic}
    webdav.kafka.topic = ${dcache.kafka.topic}
    xrootd.kafka.topic = ${dcache.kafka.topic}

Macaroons now include an Issue ID (`iid`) caveat, which dCache ensures
is the first caveat in each new macaroon.  The `iid` caveat ensures
that the ID is always unique, even when generated with the same
secret, but that derived macaroons (ones with additional caveats) may
still be identified.

By default, the WebDAV and frontend doors now reject any macaroon sent
on an unencrypted connection.  Although these doors used to accept
macaroons on unencrypted connections and this behaviour is
configurable, we recommend sites accept this change and have dCache
reject unencrypted macaroons.

This version of dCache configures systemd limits in a single place,
avoiding that ineffective configuration is included.
