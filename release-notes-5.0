<h1>What's new in dCache 5.0<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

 - dCache now supports Java 11 as its platform
 - Documentation, especially the dCache Book, received a major revision and will remain in focus
 - HTTP 3rd-party-copying has matured to a feature-rich, well tested state
 - Pinboard includes timestamps
 - updated external dependencies

## Incompatibilities
This release breaks compatibility with pools running dcache version 3.2 or earlier.

## Acknowledgments

We thank HTW Berlin students Marcel Munce, Ferdinand Wolff and MaKrHTW (???) as well
as Onno Zweers from surfSARA for their contributions.

## Release 5.0.14

### Changes affecting multiple services

This release updates the Zookeeper library shipped with dCache to version 3.4.14, which
contains fixes for CVE-2019-0201, a possible critical behaviour where unsalted hashes 
could leak to network-internal attackers.

### gplazma

Logging of problems with OpenID-Connect logins through dCache View was greatly improved.

## Release 5.0.13

### alarms

To ease troubleshooting, the POOL_DEAD alarm message now includes the pool name.

### pinmanager

A bug was fixed where PinManager's `bulk ls` admin command yielded a 
NullPointerException if the optional argument was omitted.

A typo prevented the error message "Remote connection failure while unpinning..." from
appearing completely and correctly in the logs. The error message string now contains
the message string of the underlying Exception, hopefully providing helpful details for 
troubleshooting.

### pool

A regression that prevented a replica's last access time from being updated was fixed.

A regression that prevented a replica's position in the LRU queue for garbage collection from being updated was fixed.

### webdav

Users asserting the "admin" role would occasionally receive 
NullPointerExceptions when trying to transfer files through 
WebDAV. This release fixes that issue.

## Release 5.0.12

### Changes affecting multiple services

Stage request from unknown locations resulted in NPE in dcap and pinmanager services.
this is now fixed and using `dccp` to stage a file should work even if the location is unknown. '--'

### frontend

A client that disconnects and quickly reconnects could  had  triggered the following NPE, this is now fixed.

### resilience

The current release fixed  race condition on replica state and no `inaccessible file errors` occures  for a newly written file.

## Release 5.0.11

### frontend

The destroy sequence for a channel failed to obtain the Channel
monitor. This could result in concurrent changes to the Channel's
state and incomplete Channel shutdown. This is now fixed and the shutdown sequence of a channel is more robust.


### pool

An unhelpful error message "Parameter `directory` is not a directory" is
replaced with one that provides information on which directory is
missing.

The pool no longer logs configuration or deployment problems that
prevent the pool from creating a mover as if that problem was a bug.

The current release fixed certain error cases, where a pool is unable to create a mover are no
longer logged as a bug in dCache.

### transfermanager

By default, the transfermanager will retry starting the mover ten times
before giving up on the pool. If we know that a pool doesn't support
this transfer type (for whatever reason), then this makes no sense. This is now fixed and a pool that does not support a particular transfer is not immediately
retried.

The current release fixed a NPE  if transfer was cancelled.

## Release 5.0.10

### pool

The current release improved time formatting for Json mover info.

### resilience

Faulty parsing of the error string on the `retry errors`
command results in operation failure, with message
`IllegalArgumentException: Illegal pnfsid string length`. This is now fixed.

## Release 5.0.9

### dcache

Jetty version is updated to  9.4.12.v20180830.

### nfs

nfs4j version is changed to 0.17.11 with  fixed  export table evaluation order.

### resilience

It is now possible to record resilience activity (on the receiving
end), which may prove useful in understanding
behaviour.

In rare circumstances  dark removes  can result in data loss by 
removing of all replicas for a given file. The current release fixed the issue.

Pool operations now can successfully be restarted from the
command line after they have been shutdown, without
restarting resilience.

## Release 5.0.7

### ftp

Now clients can request the checksum value of a file not owned by that
user and where dCache does not already know the checksum value.

### pnfsmanager

The current release fixed a NPE triggered by network issues.

### pool

The current release fixed some logging on the pool where messages were recorded against an
arbitrary context (i.e., the bit in square brackets), resulting in
misleading information. 

### transfermanagers

TransferManager failed a transfer if the pool reports any
problem when requesting the transfer was started. This is now fixed and third-party transfer is more robust against non-fatal errors that occur
normally on a busy system.

### xrootd

Xrootd4j is updated to version , which fixed regression in supporting TPC pre-4.9.

## Release 5.0.6

### xrootd

With this release, dCache has gained full signature verification support for xrootd.

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 5.0.5

### gplazma

Due to a formatting issue, certificates issued by InCommon CA were not accepted
because of case mismatches between the supplied "postalCode" and "street" 
and the expected "PostalCode" and "STREET" field descriptors.

Since this release, dCache handles those certificates as expected despite the
unusual naming convention.

### pool

There was an issue with the timestamps output by the `sweeper ls`
command. The command lists replica creation time and the time of 
the last access. The output for replica creation time was incorrect,
as it showed the startup timestamp for the replica's pool if that
was more recent than the actual creation time of the replica.

This issue was fixed, and the timestamps are showing the correct values now.

### scripts

The system-test build target provides a self-contained dCache deployment for
development or evaluation purposes. Due to an oversight, its GSI xrootd 
door tried instantiating the access-log plugin redundantly. This was
fixed with this release.

### webdav

When users request a macaroon via an HTTP POST request targeting
a specific path, a caveat is created that restricts the macaroon
to that path (requests to / result in a non-limited macaroon). 

Commit 99c726e3 resulted in users getting back a non-limited
macaroon for every request. This issue was fixed with this
release.

## Release 5.0.4

### admin

he current support added  direct command execution capability and  it works with support for semicolon (;) separated list of commands like so:
`ssh -p <port> user@example.com "command1; command2; command3"`.

### alarms

Pool errors involving a fatal repository fault, for
instance, can be sent now  as an email alarm without
having to send all pool disabled alarms.

### billing

Better formating for storageInfo key, when events send with kafka producer.

### dcache-view

Troubles when using firefox and/or safari to browse dcache-view were reported. This is now fixed.

### gplazma

The JAAS gplazma plugin no longer logs a stacktrace on bad configuration.

### pool

The current release improved error messages  making them clearer by avoid using the same error message in multiple places. 

The current release boosts performance  for ceph pool.

The current release fixed lookup for canonical hostname for IPv6 addresses  and now secure HTTP transfers work over IPv6 and problems are easier to diagnose.


The current release improved error message  (previously "Could not create mover") to provide
more information about why the mover could not be created.

### srm

A stack-traces fixed  for  concurrent updates in pin-manager and similar
(expected) failures.

### transfermanager

When  transfermanager returns an error to the caller (e.g., WebDAV) if
there was a problem starting the mover. This message did not include
any details describing on which pool this failure occured.  This is now fixed and HTTP TPC failures in which the pool does not start the mover now include
the pool's address in the error message. This allows admins to
investigate further.

Now Third-party transfers fail if the client is requesting to copy a file
from dCache that has not fully been uploaded.

### webdav

Disabling basic authn should not now disable macaroons. The current release fixed  `webdav.authn.basic` and `frontend.authn.basic` so that setting
these configuration properties to `false` no longer blocks macaroons from being accepted in the HTTP Authorization header.

The current release impoved error messaging  for unauthenticated request. 

IllegalArgumentException exception is fixed now and attempts by a client to copy a file that has not fully been uploaded 
results in a clear error response.

The current release added switch to reject macacroons sent unencrypted and now  following security recommendations sites may configure dCache to reject any macaroons send over an
unencrypted channel. The default behaviour is to continue accepting macaroons sent over an
unencrypted channel to avoid breaking existing deployment.

### xrootd

The current release fixed  access logging when xrootd door is configured with HAproxy.

## Release 5.0.2

### billing

Database connection loss now is reported for billing.

### docs

Improve documentation by clarifying requirement `gplazma.ldap.try-uid-mapping` option in `cookbook-transport-security.md`.

### nfs

The NFS door assumed that routable IP address, like 130.199.49.35, in general can't
access private subnet, like 10.1.1.1. This assumption was not always true for all sites
and ended up with non functional pNFS deployment.
This is now fixed.

### pool


The current release improved performance for CEPH based pools and fixed regression affected chunked uploads.

The IO chunk size can be configured now for read as well as for write.

### webdav

The current release fixed the problem where all but one requests fail, if multiple concurrent PUT requests have directories in the path that do not already exist.

## Release 5.0.1

### dcache-view

The following new functionalities have been added for dCache View:
Now it is possible to use macaroon for file sharing.
Files can be shared by sending the generated link, QR code or macaroon for the files to the person you want to give access to your files.
Gravatar request is now make optional and how the images are stored are now more efficient to reduce the number of request made.


### gplazma

Since update to newer BC and voms-java-api libraries
sites report VOMS certificate validation errors like
This is now fixed.

### nfs

The current release fixed the bug  introduced by  `ByteBuffer#limit`, which is used instead of
`Buffer#limit`.   

### srm

The `dcache ports` command now includes the srm's TLS/SSL interface.

:   dcache, frontend: release dcache-view version 1.5.1

## Release 5.0.0

### Admin

A new property in the frontend `frontend.authz.unlimited-operation-visibility`
now controls visibility of operations exposing file metadata. The default is `false`, meaning
non-admin users can only see file operations for files which they own or which are
anonymous. Setting it to `true` allows everyone access.
([267d937c79](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/267d937c79713330ae2161dd28b05ee4166d2934)).

Monitoring information exposed through
the HTTP GET method is now available to all users and not only admin role users.
([32597dc77a](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/32597dc77aeca34144a374e75ffe23e6b3b69a36)).

The admin data fields like the lists of pools, groups, units, etc., are now
sorted by default for the admin REST API.
([4928eff71d](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/4928eff71dabcc66deb3ad35a3a652ce9e1f943c)).

The dCache admin ssh server now supports kerberos as an authentication mechanism
(along with password and publickey).

[cbab40a841](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/cbab40a8415e81d96dfd775a0d28f3f9158d2eaf)
added the following property to configure admin ssh server authentication:

    (any-of?kerberos|password|publickey)admin.ssh.authn.enabled = password,publickey

The keytab's location can be set under

    admin.ssh.authn.kerberos.keytab-file = /etc/krb5.keytab

### Alarms

A bug impeding reception of email alarms when the XML database is used has been fixed.


### DCAP

Improved features: when using dcap URL to create a file or a directory,
they are created with dcap get desired file permissions.


### Frontend

dCache now supports more scientific file formats: HDF4 and 5 files as well as ROOT files are now identified and
treated as such.

The new configuration property `(one-of?true|false)dcache.enable.authn.anonymous-fallback-on-failed-login = true` allows
modifying the behaviour of the frontend in case of failed logins: dCache has a hard-coded "feature" where a user providing bad
authentication (e.g., wrong password, expired OIDC access-token or
macaroon) is treated as the anonymous user.  This has proved counter-intuitive, as wrong/expired credentials often
appear to succeed for some operations (e.g., directory listing), while
failing others (upload/download). Providing the new property allows to set a fail-fast behaviour in those cases, providing a quicker
response to users.

To support inotify events, a new plugin for SSE is introduced. Clients can discover changes in dCache namespace using an interface modelled after the inotify(7) API (See dCache book for detail).

dCache View is updated to a new version (v1.5), see dcache-view repository for new feature details.


### FTP

Bug which have been fixed:

The leaking server sockets issue , when a client aborts a proxied transfers with kafka ebnabled  is now fixed. No further server sockets leaked when a proxy is being used, Kafka
notification is enabled, and the client aborts the transfer.

Improved features:  Improve `date` value formatting when sending billing events via Kafka.


### gplazma

The credential information (e.g., distinguished name) is now logged for x509 certification chain validation and FQAN extraction failures.
([9c39e149e0](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/9c39e149e0db31a088d46ebd602fe5fd63c20eb9)).

Large numerical value gids may be used to define roles fro groupid (gid).
([11b34011ae](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/11b34011ae9c613db6aae0ca8a822853d2cf7e2a)).

Wildcard match of FQANS is possible for the VO group (`vo-group.json`) gplazma plugin.
[173dca3a96](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/173dca3a96d52acca73bac1c9ea568338095037f)).

A new role, "observer", is defined and available for according read-only access to system or file information.
([4aa440ab2a](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/4aa440ab2abd46cd1903384d2c47ecec0677eb98)).

The Storage AuthzDB file format is updated to accept an optional
'max-upload=&lt;value&gt;' element after the 'read-write' or 'read-only'
value.  The label is optional.  If present, the value describes the
maximum file size the user can upload.
([e3dce67083](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/e3dce67083166451be67c42700640eaed2597669))

As some newer authentication mechanisms embed usage limitations; i.e., a
user may authenticate in a way that limits what that user can do (E.g. SciTokens)
New authentication plugins have the possibility to specify a Restriction
as part of the authentication process.  Existing authentication plugins
are supported as before. ([204024b9e8](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/204024b9e878b85fbd6a5583908ccada4396d944)).


A new configuration option has been introduced to capture all
information about an OpenID-Connect provider, which is
some external service that dCache users can authenticate against.

This configuration property is a map.  Each entry of the map
associates a nickname with information about that provider.  The
nickname is used when logging problems with the provider.  The
information is the URI of the issuer endpoint.  This must be a
valid URL that starts 'https://'.

The following example associates the nickname 'google' with
Google's issuer endpoint.

    gplazma.oidc.provider!google = https://accounts.google.com/

([bab4e635ac](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/bab4e635ac1b451b772badc70c9b89da6892ac65)).

### History

Error handling in the history service was improved.

### Info

The info service now publishes the time that information was collected along with the actual data.
The timestamp is available via the `last-updated` attribute.

Info clients (such as info-provider and storage-report) are now informed
of the number of files stored in a space reservation.

### NFS

When pNFS client uses flex_file layout IO errors with pool (data server) are reported to NFS door. The erros can be interpreted
as:

> NFS4ERR_NXIO:  The client was unable to establish any communication
>     with the storage device.
> 
> NFS4ERR_*:  The client was able to establish communication with the
>     storage device and is returning one of the allowed error codes.

### PNFS Manager

A user with a macaroon that authorises them to upload data into a
particular directory will now also be able to create parent directories to
achieve uploading the data.

A bug that prevented `get file checksum` from working in some cases was fixed.

### Pool

Fixed pool repository space accounting leak on failed restores from tape
([815ce3eb6a](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/815ce3eb6a7898152d38abd97590336d434545c7)).

Added Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for HTTP requests ([049c87a814](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/049c87a8141e3dad7f42f2a2497f01c5db080da9)) required by dCacheView.

Fixed HTTPS redirected transfers by returning pool canonical hostname in the redirected URLs.
([7f81b8e79d](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/7f81b8e79de9de53545b23ef4fd93448bb17eb3c)).

Fixed stopwath error to ensure that IO-statistics collecting is more robust,
 avoiding stack-traces with the message 'This stopwatch is already stopped' ([86ede8a240](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/86ede8a2403598d9b9383e7ebb2a120a3eed7aeb)).

Better handling of HTTP 3-rd party transfers -  improved logging of exceptions
([a98d667c16](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/a98d667c16b2dbff774d0ca91d741de80bb02d9c)),
increased socket timeout for GET requests ([845cfe0bda](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/845cfe0bdaff4b22a1402bfa0452a1b7ef3f6d2c)). Improved error logging in billing by using exception calss name if exception has `null` message ([24de520285](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/24de52028527563309728bb9fa56504d7f75bed7)).

Removed stack-trace logging of checked exceptions on P2P failures ([7a570355fa](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/7a570355fade688b01bfbad6549c3e6fea49bf01)). Fixed pool runtime configured size regression ([f5ba0103ea](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/f5ba0103ea1b6b91b22e6c17b203fa9913ec5251)).

Updated HTTP 3-rd party copy to support retrying GET and HEAD requests for better ineroperability with
DPM ([d0a621c775](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/d0a621c77520df548b5d73155b1a0450a693bcf2)).

Updated FTP mover to log additional information if it detects partial transfers ([e725f7b9e7](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/e725f7b9e7fa86188afce578d26d4a141c69d297)). Dropped subject from StorageInfoMessage
([0e60cdcaaa](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/0e60cdcaaa96e2ca88fa116e6203b32feb10e0cf)). Fixed regression when restoring files from tape ([7cdcf4e0a7](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/7cdcf4e0a7a447d75d7c77e5fceafb56c2c76a4f)). Fixed NullPointerException on flush when using Kafka to collect billing records
([4e396b9234](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/4e396b92346da9f4a08c78a47e956a7ded05e3f9)). Fixed
protocol movers to handle out of disk/out of capacity errors.

Eliminated stack trace generated by bad input for the following admin commands:

    queue activate
    queue activate class
    queue remove class
    queue suspend class
    queue resume class
    queue remove pnfsid

([0faa607806](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/0faa607806249bba1212629e6eff6f9bca276d7f)).

Added support for Content-MD5 request header ([4d954e6b5f](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/4d954e6b5f5b92f626a40de672293790c9e0c589)).

Updated HTTP mover to report errors as HTTP status message phrase so that
clients that log the status line now provide their users with more
    detailed information about what caused a transfer to fail ([6fcaeca34c](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/6fcaeca34cb45087577889737b081a2b58cb2983)).

Fixed regression that broke `dcache pool convert` command ([80461b2f9a](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/80461b2f9ad3f881b228b6ce8c3a0857556d9220) and [80461b2f9a](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/011b3b243972c574f6002062684f0b4cc432a43f)).

Introduced a retry loop to retry file attributes update in timeout to pnfs manager ([8c60877527]((https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/8c60877527869095acf23dd95f424d1df1e5b790)).

### Pool Manager

Select Read Pool requests for which the user does not have enough permissions now do not affect other requests
any more.

Several smaller bugfixes for Pool Manager also went into this release.

### Resilience

Bugs which have been fixed:  (1) an error is no longer reported when trying to handle a broken file which has
already been unlinked; (2) the entire pool scan no longer fails when one file in the list is not resilient
or has no locations; (3) filters referencing invalid pool names no longer cause scan cancel to fail.

Improved features:  (1) command ``retry errors`` immediately reprocesses the most recent failed file operations;
(2) the command ``pool ls`` now displays the number of file operation errors encountered during a given scan;
(3) the list of pools is now sorted by STATE (RUNNING, WAITING, IDLE) and then by pool name in ascending
lexicographic order; (4) the ``inaccessible`` command now has options to check the status of the job,
to display the current contents of the 'inaccessible list' file for that pool, and to clean up/delete that file;
(5) 'referring pool' has been added to the inaccessible alarm to enable grep'ing the resilience log for
a given scanned pool.

### SRM / SRM Manager

Fixes in gridsite delegation storage handling - fixed querying validity of delegated credential stored on the gridsite end-point
 allowing clients like  `davix-cp` to work ([839604e45f](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/839604e45f5af327e6547a7fce80a828089eb6c5)) with dCache;
fixed handling of delegated credential with VOMS AC
that expires before the X.509 ([54658383d1](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/54658383d15303eecb7728ca0bbfa1f89a63d960)); imporved error reporting ([41976be12d](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/41976be12d6788a28c3cab5bdcec66763d0c9c23)); added add gridsite delegation interface access-log ([5392271fcf](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/5392271fcffb2bd6f09a1b74a52051f2e26e91e8)).

SRM client has been updated to support `X509_CERT_DIR` environmental variable ([ed8b86e604](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/ed8b86e60422b82456d0e2f4fcf9277da68bb716)).

Fixed handling of duplicate SURLs by SRM client ([36b9e0c7d6](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/36b9e0c7d68f2c4eade1875d8d0ec1f1a770c454)).


### WebDAV

A lot of work has gone into making 3rd party copying functionality more robust and scalable.

### XRootD

Third-party copy was introduced in 4.2, and continues to be improved.  For further information on configuration,
please refer to the documentation in _The Book_ (5.0).

Bug fixes and improvements:  (1) the correct error (kXR_NoSpace) is now returned to the client when there is no more disk space;
(2) xrootd now fails fast if the MaxUploadSize is supplied, and the file is too large; (3) the xrootd door spring configuration
no longer fails to load when kafka is not activated; (4) the 'stat' request now supports both open file handles as well
as paths, enabling use of the ``--zip`` option; (5) dCache no longer logs a  stack trace when a client requests a file be
created, the parent directory does not exist, and the make parent option is omitted; (6) a source path containing
a query part on a mv request no longer causes the request to fail; (7) a potential race condition preventing directory
listing now is correctly handled; (8) support for the 'tpc' query on the pools has been added in order to comply with
the newer (4.9) XrootD clients; (9) it is now no longer necessary nor correct to list 'access-log' among the xrootd plugins;
this log handler is added automatically as it is for other doors; (10) file handles and query strings are now included in
the access log information; (11) logging of failed authentication is improved to include more useful information, like
the DN; (12) it is now possible to identify all entries in the access-log from the same TCP connection via a session identifier.

### Zookeeper

The internal Zookeeper version was updated to 3.4.13.
