<h1>What's new in dCache 4.1<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

File transfers using GridFTP can now reuse TCP connections, which makes them faster and improves
compatibility with the Globus transfer service.

This release of dCache introduces a new approach to external messaging. With the introduction
of Apache-Kafka as a message transport, for now in Billing, we start switching to a more modern
and efficient messaging system. The goal for the Billing service is easier inclusion with 
systems like Elasticsearch: Instead of adding messages to a textual log and having an external
component parse that log, a Kafka-aware ingester can import them directly into the remote
system.

Various administrative tasks are now possible for users with
the 'admin' role using frontend.

The frontend REST API is documented with Swagger, allowing the
auto-generation of clients.

The frontend also now comes with a built-in web-browser based Swagger
client.

The configuration of several components has been simplified. For example, creating LDAP-only setups
for gplazma now only requires the configuration of a single plugin, `ldap`. 

## Incompatibilities

  - Starting from version 4.1 dCache head nodes are incompatible with pools older that 3.0.
  - NFSv4.1/pNFS is not compatible with older linux kernels when used with flexfile layout.
    As a result, by updating to dCache-4.1 a new export options can be used to enforce layout
    driver. If nothing is specified, then nfsv4_1_files only is offered to the clients. For
    linux clients with kernel versions starting from 4.14 as well as RHEL-7.5 is flexfile layout
    is recommended.
    ```
    / moder_client_host(rw,lt=nfsv4_1_files:flex_files)
    ```
    The **nfs.pnfs.layouts** property is obsolete in favour of **lt=** export option.
     
### Acknowledgements
Once again, we have received important code contributions from our users. 

Thanks to Christoph Anton Mitterer for his constributions.

We would like to thank the students of HTW Berlin Alexandra Konovalova, Hagen Wittlich and Marcus Kopp,
for their contributions during the HTW course.

## Release 4.1.21

### frontend

When a user does not have the permission to read a file (or is simply
not logged in), dCache would previously report a 500 
Internal Server Error. This error reporting was improved, 
reporting 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden
as appropriate.

### ftp

If the ftp client requests a proxied passive transfer with a different
IP family from the control channel (i.e., the client connects using IPv6
and requests an IPv4 data channel, or vice versa) the ftp server must
select which IP address it should return to the client.

As pointed out by Francesco Prelz (thanks!), the door currently selects
the first address from the same interface that has the desired IP
family. However, this may not be accessible by the client.

This release updates address selection so that only usable addresses
will be returned to the clients.

### info

Clients querying the info service (such as info-provider
and storage-report) are now informed
of the number of files stored in a space reservation.

The info service now displays the time at which the information it displays
was recorded.

### poolmanager

This release increases responsiveness for users that are not allowed to stage files, and for NFS users who access offline files. 
In cases where such a user issued a read request at the same time that Pool Manager handled
a staging request, the first request would block for the duration of the staging -- potentially
quite a while. From now on, users that are not allowed to stage receive appropriate error
messages as soon as possible, without having to wait for anyone else.

### xrootd

Support for xrootd `mkdir` was improved.

## Release 4.1.20

### sysytemd

Systemd did  not inherite the system-wide limits and was  completely ignoring  `/etc/security/limits.d/92-dcache.conf`.
This is now fixed and the limits successfully loaded and enabled as expected.

### vehicles

The current release has fixed serialization regression in `FileCorruptedCacheException`.

:   systemd: Add `/etc/security/limits.d/92-dcache.conf` in the dcache systemd unit and generator.

## Release 4.1.19

### Changes affecting multiple services

This rlease fixes an issue with WebDAV 3rd-party-copy requests that are
authorized using a macaroon that is only valid for writing a specific file.

NOTE: both the webdav door and transfermanagers must be updated before
the fix is effective. 

The timeout used by dCache when attempting to send a Kafka event is now
adjustable via the configuration properties dcache.kafka.maximum-block
and dcache.kafka.maximum-block.unit.

The default timeout for pools, and the xrootd, nfs and webdav doors is
now non-zero. This should fix the problem of kafka events being lost
under normal operational conditions.

### pool

In order to help with debugging issues with partial FTP transfers, 
dCache pools now are able to log considerable information about failed FTP
transfers. 

This is controlled by the new property `pool.mover.ftp.enable.log-aborted-transfers`.

### webdav

dCache can now transfer data with a remote site, authenticating with
that remote site using a delegated X.509 credential, but authenticating
locally with a macaroon.

### xrootd

This release updates xrootd4j, which should help fix occasional "pad block corrupted" issues with older clients.

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 4.1.18

### frontend

The current release fixed broken directory QoS reporting and now frontend now more accurately describes the QoS of directories; i.e., the
QoS that newly written files will receive when written into this
directory, assuming none of the targeted pools are volatile.

### webdav

the macaroon creation with multiple path restrictions failed with a http error 500 and the error message.
 This is now fixed and the macaroon creation succeeds when multiple path restrictions are defined.

The current release improved  error handling for PROPFIND request.

## Release 4.1.17

### dcache-view

Several fixes has been implemented  for  dcache-view:  openid connect redirect handling is fixed, fixed file download.

### ftp

dCache now has the ability to log the current status of a transfer at the point the client decided to abort an FTP transfer. 
This should support a post mortem investigation on why a transfer was cancelled.

### nfs

With the current release the timeout of pnfshandler is configurable and nfs door quicker
 recovers from situations, when a PnfsManager is not available.

## Release 4.1.16

### NFS

When two clients A and B operate on a file in quick succession, A opening the
file and B deleting it before LAYOUTGET is called, dCache puts the 
transfer into the list of active transfers and returned NFS4ERR_NOENT. If a
client tries to optimize the corresponding CLOSE call away, as some do, 
the entries are never removed from the list, effectively creating a leak.

This problem was fixed. Clients now receive an NFS4ERR_STALE message in those
cases.

### core

Certain transfer failures, such as attempting to
use a space-reservation that has insufficient capacity, resulted in the
door eventually reporting a time-out problem to the client.

A typical error message would resemble

```Request to [>SpaceManager@local ... ] timed out.```

This problem was traced to an internal misconfiguration of a messaging
component and is fixed from this release onwards.

### frontend

The reporting of a file's QoS status in frontend was improved. Files
that are being scheduled for moving to tape are now reported as 
'tape' instead of 'disk'.

### pool

In some cases, storage info data was not included in messages issued during
a pool flush. This caused an irrelevant NPE to be logged. 

This problem was solved, and as a side effect of the fix, billing records
now have the correct format when reporting on flushes:

```08.24 15:24:41 [pool:dcache-lab002-A@dcache-lab002Domain:store] [00006BD12E8925744156AAE87641D4AF73BB,1362] [/] 100013 2 {10006:"Flush was cancelled."}```

vs.

```8.24 15:51:07 [pool:dcache-lab002-A@dcache-lab002Domain:store] [00005C1387649DD74E0491DFE9A98D97DC39,1362] [/] data:sla2@osm 100015 1 {10006:"Flush was cancelled."}``` 

A bug was fixed that occasionally caused problems with the pools' 
Berkeley DB. This could, for example, be triggered by removing files
which were in a flush queue. 

A typical error message was, e.g.

```
27 Aug 2018 12:09:33 (cat2_lhcbtape) [Frontend-dcacheview PoolDataRequest] Fault occurred in repository: Internal repository error. Pool restart required: : CacheExcept
ion(rc=204;msg=Meta data lookup failed and a pool restart is required: (JE 7.3.7) Environment must be closed, caused by: com.sleepycat.je.ThreadInterruptedException: En

uired: Internal repository error
```

### webdav

Web clients (such as web-browsers) make OPTIONS pre-flight requests to
discover what they are allowed to do, according to the CORS standard.

Unfortunately, some web-browsers make the OPTIONS request without
presenting any credentials. If the resource is within a protected
directory then dCache currently fails the OPTIONS request.

This release introduces a new behaviour where such requests will always
succeed, so that browser pre-flight requests are not hampered.

## Release 4.1.15

### gplazma

The OidcAuthPlugin  plugin was  updated so that users whos op does not claim
 `name`, and does not claim `given_name` nor
`family_name` can use dCache.

### pool

This release fixed  the log stack-trace for `queue` admin commands and now bad admin input for the following admin commands no longer results in a stack-trace being logged:

* queue activate
* queue activate class
* queue remove class
* queue suspend class
* queue resume class
* queue remove pnfsid

### poolmanager

 NPE is fixed when staging files back from tape and
`poolmanager.enable.cache-hit-message` is true.

### webdav

The current release updated   default credential delegation for third-party copy so that now requesting a third-party copy using a macaroon does not trigger a failed
attempt to OpenID-Connect delegation.

## Release 4.1.14

### history

This release fixes a bug that could cause startup errors
in the history service in the face of network errors. 

### many

Remote pool monitor would occasionally log stack traces from exceptions  
when a domain shut down due to an interrupt. This has been fixed, reducing
the number of irrelevant log entries in such situations.

## Release 4.1.13

### nfs

dCache 4.1 now uses nfs4j version 0.16.2, which includes a bugfix that should
help avoid some rarely observed deadlocks with current Linux clients.

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 4.1.12

### PNFS

### pool

HTTP responses now contain more meaningful messages along with the 
HTTP response codes, instead of only just showing stock messages
like "400 Bad request". 

### webdav

When the WebDAV door proxies a transfer and a transfer failure occurs, the
door previously always just reported "500 Internal Error". This reporting
is now improved, with any more detailed error messages from (possibly) 
other services taking precedence. For example, if a pool returns a 400 error code, 
thus complaining about the client's request, this code is reported instead, 
which should help with diagnosing the error's cause.

## Release 4.1.11

### resilience

Resilience suffered from a bug that would lead to a NoSuchElementException when a pool name no longer 
mapped to a location known to the Resilience service. This issue has been fixed.

When multiple pools go offline it is possible that
all replicas for a given resilient file become unreadable.
If the file is not CUSTODIAL, and thus cannot be restored
from tape, the discovery of such a file during scanning
will generate an error in the 'history errors' listing,
in the resilience domain .resilience log, and will also
raise a general alarm concerning the pool.


There currently exists a command, 'inaccessible', which
generates a listing of the pnfsids on a given pool
which in the current state of dCache have no readable 
replicas.  However, this command takes a while to complete
(asynchronously), and the output is written to a file
which must be viewed by logging in.

This release introduces 'refering pool' information to the
error output so that grepping the resilience log for a given
pool becomes easier, and adds options to the command to check
further details.

## Release 4.1.10

### scripts

A regression in the `dcache pool convert` command was fixed; the command works again.

### scripts

The instructions that are printed out once `dcache pool convert`
completes successfully now correctly point to the 
property that needs to be updated, namely `pool.plugins.meta`.

## Release 4.1.9

### frontend

The frontend now correctly handles situations where a transfer that is already
completed is killed. Be aware that in order to make use of the bugfix, both
the pools and the head nodes need to be updated to at least 4.1.9. 

### ftp

Since commit [eefb964](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/eefb9641e9c4c5ff0ee5f6793928e311b334a064),
3rd-party-transfers using ftp between two dCache endpoints had an issue
where connections were not reliably closed. This release fixes the problem.

### pool

This release improves dCache's robustness against network errors: In case 
registering a file with PNFS manager fails due to a timeout, the request
is retried transparently.

## Release 4.1.8

### dcache-view

Now there is a live update of QoS when changed. The current release added the following fixes: fixed the upload toast to show the current status,
 fixed regression regarding the processing of click events on vaadin-grid tables and fixed path request in view-file. 

### door

The current release added  support for a door advertising multiple hostnames or IP addresses.
dCache doors can  now advertise multiple interfaces, including DNS aliases.

### webdav

Milton's OPTIONS handler was returning  a 404 error if an OPTIONS request
targets an entity that did not exist. This behavior deviated from
Apache httpd server and was resulting  in failed uploads for dcache-view.
The current release fixed.

## Release 4.1.5

### dcache-resilience

There was a small regression in the way resilience computes
the number of operations necessary to adjust copies when
a storage unit definition changes.

The current rellease fixed  computation of operation count when storage requirements change.

### ftp

In order to aid diagnosing problems when FTP response being lost, now dcache  logs failures to wrap/encrypt responses.

### webdav

The current release improved error handling for client authentication with OpenID-Connect.
 A more complete set of information is now logged if OIDC delegation fails,
supporting the ability to discover why the delegation failed.

## Release 4.1.4

### ftp

Error reporting in the FTP service has been improved: in some mixed IPv4 / IPv6 scenarios,
only unclear error messages were reported.

## Release 4.1.3

### frontend

The current release improved `REST API` swagger documentation that describes which aspects of
dCache are affected by related operations.

### nfs

Situations, where selection process was incomplete could not  be manually recovered
When selection process incomplete, due to `PoolManager` restart, there was no way  to trigger a new selection.
The current release added  two new commands to `nfs door`:  `transfer retry` and `transfer forget`.  

The first command manually re-activates  existing transfer by re-trying selection process. 
The second one should be  used to  completely 'forget' the stale transfer and let client to trigger a fresh selection process.

## Release 4.1.2

### ftp

A NullPointerException could occasionally occur in ftp. This issue was fixed in this release.

The ftp door now provides far more detailed proxy information (including 
ASCII-art diagrams of connection status).

FTP has received extra debug-level logging to ease debugging.

### gplazma

gplazma now supports a Fermilab-specific authorization data source in JSON format.

### pool

During active ftp transfers, connection problems would lead to the rather unhelpful error
message "451 General problem". This error reporting was refactored, so that diagnosis
of the cause is now greatly facilitated.

### poolmanager

A potential NullPointerException (that was not observed in real-world usage until now)
was fixed in Pool Manager.

### resilience

A correction to resilience's error handling results in no more reports on
non-resilient (but corrupted) files. 

### spacemanager

In order to facilitate debugging, Space Manager now logs link-group related content
in greater detail.

## Release 4.1.1

### Changes affecting multiple services

This version removes the (by now unused) directory /var/lib/cell-info
from a default installation. The directory was previously used to store
cell info data. With the introduction of the history service in dCache 3.2.1,
this became obsolete.

A small bug-fix addresses wrong directory permissions on tar or Debian
packages, where the directory /var/lib/dcache/pool-history had the
wrong permissions.

The deprecated properties for configuring alarms have now finally been made 
unavailable.

### chimera

An internal update enables chimera to use PostgreSQL 10.

### nfs

A modification in IP address handling greatly increases the speed of 
NFS client access for Linux clients in mixed IPv4/IPv6 environments.

Prior to Linux 4.12, Linux clients with only an IPv4 address would wait
for (timeout * retry) seconds when connecting to pools with both a v4 and v6 
address. This was [fixed upstream in Linux 4.12](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6ea44adce91526700535b3150f77f8639ae8c82d), but that fix was not
backported to e.g. RHEL 7 yet.

## Release 4.1.0


### Billing

A newly-introduced configuration property `dcache.enable.kafka` controls whether the Kafka messaging
system is used for message delivery.

Two new global options to control publishing via Kafka have been added:

```
dcache.enable.kafka = true|false
dcache.kafka.bootstrap-servers= host1:port,host2:port
```

The kafka topic is **billing** and is currently not configurable. The records are written as JSON 
objects, like:



    {  
        "msgType": "request",  
        "mappedUID": 0,  
        "date": "Fri Mar 02 10:48:41 CET 2018",

        "subject": [

          "GidPrincipal[0]",  
          "Origin[131.169.240.87]"  
        ]  
      }  

### Frontend

The 4.0 release saw the introduction of a range of RESTful services which
provide an administrative overview of the system.  There have been
a few minor changes in the intervening releases. The API is now stable with 4.1.

To summarize:  these services provide overviews of file data,
poolmanager configuration, service state, pool configuration and activity,
and system alarms. One can obtain full information on individual files by pnfsid;
billing records for reads, writes, p2ps, stores, restores and removes of a
given file are also available if your system is configured to use the billing
database.  With the database also comes histogram data for tracking reads,
writes, p2ps, stores and restores over intervals of 24 hours, 1 week, 1 month
and 1 year.

Histogram data on pool queues and file lifetime is similarly aggregated over
pools and pool groups.  This data collection is actually done by the history
service (introduced in 3.2), with which the frontend communicates,
so it is only available if the former has been deployed.

Finally, information corresponding roughly to the poolmanager.conf file is
furnished by the selection service API, while the space management API
provides link group and space token information.

With 4.1 also comes integration with Swagger.  All RESTful services have been
provided with basic annotations in order automatically to generate API documentation.
A convenient web interface which allows exploration and testing of the API,
describing paths, parameters, error codes and JSON output, now runs at:

```
https://[host]:3880/api/v1.
```

Consulting this page is the easiest way to familiarize yourself with the API.

A number of properties have been added to the defaults for the frontend, most
of which have to do with communication with other services (timeouts, endpoints,
etc.).  Consult the frontend.properties file for details.

### FTP

GridFTP defines a set of different transfer modes, among them streaming mode (MODE S) and
extended block mode (MODE E). MODE E transfers now support keeping the data connection alive 
in between uploads, resulting in significantly higher throughput and providing better compatibility
with the Globus transfer service.

### gplazma
The LDAP plugin is updated to natively support **auth** phase. As a result,
there is need for an extra mutator plugin to use ldap based authentication
```
    auth     optional   ldap
    map      sufficient ldap
```
NOTICE, that even it's not required to use ldaps:// url, it STRONGLY avised to do so!

The configuration of LDAP-only-setups, which are becoming more important, is now much easier.
Previously, the plugins `jaas`, `mutator` and `ldap` were necessary for such a setup. Now, the 
`ldap` module is sufficient. An example of a new-style gplazma configuration file would be:

```
 auth     optional   ldap
 map      optional   ldap
 session  optional   ldap
 identity optional   ldap
```

This functionality relies on using either OpenJDK or Oracle JDK.


### NFS
New export option **lt=** to control layout types is added. The supported values are:
   - flex_files
   - nfsv4_1_files
While it is recommended to use the flex_files layout type, only modern kernel versions (and RHEL 7.5)
are supporting it. If kernel client capabilities are unknown, use nfsv4_1_files, which is the
default behaviour.


### Pool
Added configuration option to publish billing records into apache-kafka queue:

```
pool.enable.kafka = true|false
pool.kafka.bootstrap-servers= host1:port,host2:port
```

Added IO statistics to monitor storage performance.
Billing can now log, for read and write operations, the mean bandwidth
of each IO request and time that the disk system was handling requests
and idling.  It is important to note that the dCache configuration that describes the billing log
format must be updated before these values are actually recorded.


### Resilience

In the various 4.0 releases, resilience was improved in a number ways.  We
summarize them here.

First, a number of fixes have made it more robust:  uncaught
exceptions should no longer allow tasks to get stuck in the queue, and
the logic concerning available file sources when clear cache location messages
has been fixed.  In addition, we have fixed the way fatal error alarms
are generated so as to avoid spamming the alarm service and domain logs
(there is now a special resilience log for recording these errors on a
file-by-file basis, configured as usual via properties and logback.xml).

Two features have been added to resilience which enhance its usability.
The first involves a redefinition of what pools it considers to be accessible
as opposed to usable (writable) for making copies.  With this change it is
now possible to close off a resilient pool from external writes while still
allowing resilience to use it, i.e., by setting

```
\s resilient-pool-1 pool disable -store
```

Resilience no long considers such a pool 'inaccessible'.  The rule is now:
a pool is readable (by external clients) unless its disabled flags include
'fetch', and is writable (by resilience) unless its disabled flags include
-p2p-client.

The second new feature is integration of staging into resilience. Files
which are CUSTODIAL ONLINE (i.e., resilient but also stored on tape)
will now be automatically restored from tape if all their current replicas
are not accessible (e.g., because all those pools have gone offline). Since
this is achieved via communication with the Pool Manager, we have made sure that
a resilient group whose pools are connected to tape (viz. for stores) but for
which staging has been disabled will nonetheless receive the first restored
replica via p2p from some other eligible staging pool selected by the Pool
Manager.

The default sorting order for the admin history and history errors commands
has been changed from descending to ascending (more user friendly).

Resilience has now been running for almost a year on a number of systems at
DESY and elsewhere with reliable and performant results.


### Zookeeper
Updated external zookeeper libraries to version 3.4.11
