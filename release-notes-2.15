## Executive summary

Highlights from this release:

* Improved glob patterns.
* More robust handling of over load situations.
* fsck for Chimera on upgrade.
* Reduced storage requirements for Chimera.
* Chimera can store multiple checksum for a file.
* Admin shell documentation updates.
* gPlazma restriction attributes.
* Set ACLs through DCAP.
* Pool startup improvements.

## Incompatibilities

* Some configuration properties have been deprecated or made
  obsolete. `dcache check-config` can tell you if you are affected.
* Several Chimera schema changes are applied upon upgrade. To
  downgrade those schema changes have to be rolled back prior to
  downgrade.
* Several bugs have been fixed. In the unlikely event that you
  relied on these bugs, upgrading may break your installation.
* X.509 proxy certificate source address restrictions are now
  enforced. Clients that relied on these not being enforced will
  fail after upgrade.

## Release 2.15.33

### chimera

The current release fixed database query for storing multiple checksums for a file.

### ftp

The Socket `read` method may return zero to indicate that no bytes were
read. Although this is not an error, such occurances will result
in a transfer failing.

This is now fixed.

## Release 2.15.31

### ftp

The current release improves compatibility between dCache FTP client and Globus GridFTP server.


### srm

During an ATLAS stress-test of tape recalls, it was discovered that
various sites had relatively short request lifetimes. However, the SRM
spec provides the opportunity for the server to inform the client (FTS,
in this case) of what lifetime a request actually has.
The current release includes the requests remaining lifetime in the response from the server.

The current release improves the documentation to help Admins to have a better understanding how to configure dCache correctly.

## Release 2.15.30

### xrootd

In https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/459, it became apparent that dCache could improve xrdcp compatibility by sending
checksum information in lower case. This release contains this change, which should improve xrootd operations.

## Release 2.15.27

### cleaner

Users reported that they wanted to see space freed up by cleaner processes
to be reported as free as soon as possible. This patch sends notifications
about freed up space more often, resulting in quicker status updates.

### pool

A problem was fixed that could cause the csm check to fail on pools 
containing broken files.

## Release 2.15.25

### dcap

Connections of non-DCAP clients to a dCache no longer result in stack-traces in the logs.

## Release 2.15.24

### Changes affecting multiple services

Fixed a bug in admin and in the pool manager rebalancer component that
caused these to not detect certain error replies from other components.

Internal notification processing between cleaners and Pin Manager, Replica Manager and Space Manager was improved and runs quicker now.

### billing

If a dCache instance was shut down while the billing service was in the middle of a refresh,
an exception was logged and shutdown was delayed. A change in exception handling fixes this rare
scenario, ensuring a quick shutdown and no unnecessary log entries.

### dcap

This release makes it possible for admins to ban outdated, problematic versions of dcap clients. 
Some old client versions contain a bug that causes the
client to make unsatisfiable requests to a pool with no way for dCache
to reject the request: the client will simply retry. 

The client version limits are exposed using the new configuration property `dcap.limits.client-version`.
The default is to allow all dcap client versions, unchanged from the previous behaviour. 

This release fixes a regression through which Kerberos dcap would not work for host principals containing a '-' character. GSI dcap was not affected.

### doors

Fixed a bug in the lb set tags command in doors that prevented setting
an empty list of tags.

### pool

A bug that caused non-critical stack traces to be logged on the pool after
stage or deletion failure from nearline storage has been fixed.

## Release 2.15.22

### billing

Fixed a problem in the output of the `dcache billing` command using
JSON or YAML when the billing format includes a custom date format.

### dcap

Add support for the dcap client supplying additional version
information.

### gplazma

Fix `explain login` and `test login` commands so they are able to test
logging in with username and password.

Add examples to `explain login` command help.  Our thanks to Onno
Zweers for this change.

### httpd

Fix regression in the `transfers.txt` output format.

Update the transfers.html page so it no longer includes `<unknown>`
for default/unknown protocols.  With this version of dCache, these are
represented by a `?` character.  The webadmin page is updated to give
consistent output.

### scripts

Fix the billing indexer to ignore the `format` string, if present.

## Release 2.15.21

### commons

If dCache's internal ShellApplication framework detects a critical behaviour
that might indicate a bug in the application, error messages now include
an explicit request to send a mail to the developers and more relevant
information for assessing and reproducing the situation.

### gplazma2

This release fixes a small bug in GPlazma which inappropriately 
tried to handle non-DN subjects in x509 certificates.
These will usually fail in gPlazma anyway, but the reported error 
was confusing.

### srm

Handling of DNS names without trailing dots in certificates has been made more robust and universal.

## Release 2.15.20

### cells

In rare cases, an interrupt needed to cleanly shut down the location manager connector would not arrive. This issue was corrected, ensuring more reliable behaviour on cell shutdown.

Fixed a problem in which threads could inappropriately be created as daemon threads,
causing problems in killing those threads when the cell shuts down.

## Release 2.15.19

### commons

The \s admin command uses the toString method to serialise the requested
so that the remote cell may correctly parse it. This did not always
work: '=' characters in arguments were escaped but not unescaped;
arguments that start with a '-' character were not escaped; empty words
were lost. In the current release this is fixed and \s command works  as  expected.

### dcache

The current release fixes  a regression in which the exit code of check-config would
always be zero even when errors were detected.

## Release 2.15.18

### alarms

Alarm email notifications are now sent only on the first occurrence
of given alarm (i.e., for that alarm instance's unique ID).

If an alarm has been closed and not deleted,
but then occurs again, the counter for receiving that alarm
is now reset to 1, in order to treat this as a new (set of)
occurrences, and to guarantee a new notification will be sent.

### webadmin

Due to an implementation detail in a library used for the webadmin pages, filtering 
tables was a bit unintuitive until now: A filter that was set in a certain table column would
reappear on tables in other browser windows if they had similar columns. 

This behaviour was corrected, and tables on different pages exposed simultaneously in different
browser tabs are now filtered independently. However, the fix also has the side effect that
now with page reloads and form submissions the filters are cleared. Any commands, however, will 
always be issued correctly.

Filtering rows in webadmin tables could occasionally lead to unintuitive behaviour with regard to selections:
Filtering a table and hiding rows may be included in a "select all" or "deselect all" operation.
This was fixed, and selection/Deselection of hidden rows is now prevented.

Issues with filter boxes disappearing or filters resetting have been solved by disabling
AJAX auto refresh for the affected pages.

## Release 2.15.17

### chimera

Chimera occasionally suffered from (operationally irrelevant) IllegalStateExceptions. Those are now avoided.

### doors

Doors could get stuck temporarily if a file was deleted during pool selection. This has been fixed, and in such cases, transfers are now aborted properly.

## Release 2.15.16

### billing

When using the `dcache billing` command with a non-default date format in the billing file, an unneccessary stack trace was printed. This has been corrected.

### srm

The SRM should periodically (by default every 10 minutes) delete obsolete historic data (older than 10 days by default) from the database. For cases where there are problems with that process, error logging and robustness against temporary database problems have been improved.

### webadmin

The Wicket library used by dCache internally issued warnings about upcoming naming changes. Those cluttered the log files, and are silenced from the current version on.

## Release 2.15.15

### ftp

The Apache Commons FtpClient can issue the LIST command with the
non-standard `-a` option. Which was  causing dCache to switch
output format from the long (`ls -l`-like) to the short (`ls`-like)
response. This is fixed now and dCache is more compatible with Apache Commons FtpClient.

## Release 2.15.14

### cells

If the `create` command in CellShell fails because of unreadable setup files, it throws an IOException. This was incorrectly reported as a bug. Reporting has been corrected now.

In rare cases, active transfers would show up with an incorrect state in the active transfers page of the admin backend. This was fixed, so that ransfers which are staging from non-DCAP doors are correctly indicated (in yellow) on the active transfers page, instead of showing up as "No Mover found" (in red).

### common

If there is an IOException when trying to read a setup file, the corresponding file name is now listed in the error message.

### poolmanager

An issue with PoolManager prevented it from delivering correct cost estimates. This was fixed, resulting in improved estimations of pool load.

## Release 2.15.11

### alarms

A change to the alarms system improves handling of alarms with unset types.

### nfs

A race condition in the NFS door that could result in the creation of
multiple inconsistent copies of a file being uploaded has been fixed.

### pool

A regression was fixed that caused the `jtm go` command to occasionally not work.

When a transfer's status is queried before the transfer is initiated,
which can occasionally happen for queued requests, Exceptions were logged. 
This behaviour has now been corrected, providing more robust operation.

Several race conditions in the pool's migration module are fixed now.

A regression prevented queues to be set to not handle any jobs at all. The fix allows to pass a limit of 0 to `mover set max active`.

A regression was fixed that caused pools to "leak" movers if those were cancelled
while still being queued.

### spacemanager

Fixes a compatibility problem with NFS in which space manager would fail with
a duplicate key error.

### srm

A hint to describe the necessity to include escaping has been added.

The current release fixes issues in which the use of SRM third party copy operations could cause
the SRM cell to become unresponsive, possibly even run out of memory.

## Release 2.15.10

### Changes affecting multiple services

Fix security vulnerability.  Affects following services: dcap, ftp,
srm, transfermanagers, webdav and xrootd.

## Release 2.15.9

### admin

The admin door now generates SSH keys to ensure compatibility with OpenSSH 7. Additionally,
a new property `admin.paths.host-keys` was introduced in the admin.properties file, 
allowing to specify the location of keys.

### pool

A minor documentation error for the `rep ls` command was fixed.

### script

When a pool's metadata conversion operations would fail, an error caused
a script to report successful conversions. This error has been fixed now.

### webdav

There are WebDAV clients that do not send a `User-Agent` header along with 
their requests. dCache's WebDAV code has been updated to avoid 
NullPointerExceptions occuring in those cases.

## Release 2.15.8

### admin

First observed on Ubuntu Xenial, dCache fails to install on modern 
Linux distributions due to the short key length of the SSH 1 keys 
generated in the post install script. This patch removes those keys
and their generation code. dCache has been supporting only modern 
key formats for quite some time now, so this change should not have
any impact on users.

### pool

When creating movers, some error conditions are expected to 
occur and dCache is designed to transparently recover from 
these. Consequently, this patch lowers the log level for the
related error messages to reflect that their causes are 
harmless.

Fixed a staging problem that would lead to failures in 
nearline COPY operations.

### srm

Some race conditions during SRM startup were fixed. Those race conditions
could potentially have lead to failures to expire jobs and to wrong job 
counts in the SRM schedulers.

### webdav

Until now, trying to access a file for which the client was not authorized
would generate a reply with a status code 200 OK, but an empty body, rather
than an error page. This patch corrects that behaviour and also improves
exception handling for that case.

## Release 2.15.7

### billing

The data used to create the 24 hour billing overviews is aggregated
in hourly intervals before creating the plots. However, if there is
very high activity on the system during an entire 24 hour period,
there have occasionally been timeouts when querying the database for
this aggregate data. This patch makes the data aggregation more robust
against such situations, resulting in lower latency for histogram
generation and no more timeouts.

### core

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is used to query status
information about certificates during authentication. dCache supports
this protocol, but relies on a functioning OCSP server for it to work
properly. This patch changes the default OCSP mode for dCache to IGNORE,
effectively disabling it, which is helpful for sites without a
working OCSP server in place.

### gplazma

Previously, attempts to authenticate users against an htpasswd entry
that was malformed resulted in a stack trace. This patch modifies
the error handling so that only a detailed error message
("Bad entry in file: hash does not start '$1$' or '$apr1$") is logged.

## Release 2.15.6

### Changes affecting multiple services

Fixed an issue with the dcache heap `dump command` when called with a simple file name as the output path. 
In this case the dump could in some cases be written to a different directory while the script claimed the dump had failed.
The dcache dump heap command has a `--force` option for cases in which the
JVM is unresponsive. This option was ignored for processes not running
as root.
This is fixed now.

### cells

Fixed a problem causing FTP and DCAP per connection instances to subscribe
to topics they should not subscribe to. This reduces overhead caused by
routing updates.

Fixes a problem during shutdown in which communication tunnels between
domains were shut down too early.

Fixed an issue that would cause log messages in which placeholders had
not been replaced with actual values.

A bouncing message bug in System cell is fixed.

### chimera

Sql statement is fixed to use correct field.

### pnfsmanager

Reduces transaction length of flush processing in pnfs manager.

Setting atime-gap to -1 (default value) should disable file's last access time updates. 
Nevertheless, this was not the case and atime update was always enabled. 
This is fixed now and file's last access time can be disabled as described in the documentation.

This release reintroduces multiple pnfs manager queues - one per thread - to avoid possible
lock contention in chimera. Please note, that this realease reintroduces as well request folding.

### pool

Fixes an issue with pools becoming unresponsive in case of slow DNS reverse
lookups.

Fix race condition in request scheduler.

Fixes a couple of regressions in the pool meta data utilities. The `dcache pool
convert` command now opens the source database in read-only mode, preventing 
that the source is modified. Both the `dcache pool yaml` and `dcache pool
convert` commands now work without accessing the data files, making them faster 
and allowing them to be used without the data files being present.

If FTP clients disconnect mid-transfer, pools log a DoorTransferFinished delivery failure as the door is gone.
This is fixed now and log messages like `Failed to deliver DoorTransferFinishedMessage message` are suppressed in pools.

When cancelling a job in a state that doesn't allow cancellation, an illegal
state exception is thrown. This was logged as a bug.
This is now fixed.

Pool to pool transfers are supposed to be cancellable, but was not working as the `HttpURLConnection` does not appear 
to react to thread interrupt. This could lead to migration job and rebalance job cancellation appearing to hang.
This is now fixed.

Fixed a race condition in pool startup that could lead to invalid link
counts, resulting in premature deletion of files still open.

Fixes several performance regressions in pools that reduced mover creation rate
and could cause pools to become unresponsive due to lock contention.

Fixed a problem in which the meta data store was not closed properly
in the `dcache pool convert` and `dcache pool yaml` utilities.

### poolmanager

The rebalancer commands used blocking sequential messaging to all pools
in a pool group from the main pool manager message thread. This blocked
all pool manager cell communication for the duration of the rebalancer
commands during the start and cancellation.
This is fixed now.

### srm

Fixed a bug that caused delivery failures of credential service announcements
to be logged.
The `ls -completed=n` command has been observed to fail with
SRMInvalidRequestException.
This is fixed now and the 
output format of listing list requests has been changed to match that
of other requests.

### srmclient

The SRM client scripts support discovering necessary paths by
navigating relative to the script's path. This technique does not work
with `RHEL-7` since they have `/bin` as a symbolic link to `/usr/bin`.
This is fixed in this release and SRM client scripts work on `SL-7`, `CENTOS-7`, `RHEL-7`.

### webdav

Http Basic Authentication was broken and was not triggering a browser
login prompt. This resulted in authorization denied. 
This is fixed now.

## Release 2.15.5

### chimera

An internal database trigger was updated to insert data in the correct table, thus fixing a problem with the Enstore client.

When accessing a file for reading, the atime value must be updated. Previously, due to an error, the ctime (intended to reflect the time of changes to file attributes) was also changed. This update corrects that problem.

### http

In order to increase the performance of the Billing system, reverse DNS lookups were removed from the code. While this will result in IP addresses representing hosts in the billing file, DNS performance no longer impacts overall system performance.

### many

When representing checksums in the admin interface and configuration files, checksums are now presented in an improved format.

### nfs

This change fixes a NullPointerException that could occur upon file removals when using NFSv3.

Using NFS, a client will poll actively while a file is not available. In order to increase overall system performance, this change introduces a fail-fast behaviour in case the requested file is not available on disk. This will result in more responsive NFS doors from a users' perspective.

### pool

The nearline storage subsystem uses thread pools to manage its workload. Since some tasks are blocking, very high activity can cause these thread pools to grow beyond effective sizes. This may even lead to the pool becoming unresponsive.

This change introduces a new configuration property, `pool.limits.nearline-threads`, which limits the thread pool size. The default value, 30, is chosen to be sufficient for almost all imaginable use cases while at the same time avoiding potential problems with resource exhaustion.

### srm

This update fixes a regression that caused the SRM to hang during startup. The root cause was a problem in cell lifecycle communications.

Due to a timing issue, an initial service announcement in the SRM was sent before any listeners could register for those announcements. Thus, upon startup, a delivery error would be logged. With this patch, sending of the initial message is delayed until after the registration of listeners, and the irrelevant error messages are avoided.

When building rpm files a package `which` is now explicitly required as a dependency.

### cells

This change fixes a bug in routing manager that would leave orphaned topic routes in
dCache domain.

## Release 2.15.3

### cells

LoginManager would occasionally generate error messages similar to "Discarding listening on $LOCATION 53684' because its age of 18721640 ms exceeds its time to live of 4500 ms.". This was due to erroneous reuse of old message envelopes in the internal messaging. This change fixes that problem.

This change addresses a potential problem in which messages sent between cells in the same domain could appear older than they are and thus would risk being discarded due to the time-to-live being expired.

Contains corrections to cells logging. The routing manager pinboard now shows information previously logged to various other cells.

### srm

A Tier-1 site reported problems with a major WLCG VO's read requests. Investigating the source of the problems showed that the srm_ifce library, used by the (outdated) GFAL v1 and the (supported) GFAL v2 SRM libraries, drastically limits the permitted lifetime of requests without providing admins any way to configure this. 

For sites seeing errors related to desiredTotalRequestTime being exceeded, this change provides the new configuration option srm.request.maximum-client-assumed-bandwidth in srm.properties as a work-around. 

Sites not observing such errors do not need to change anything with regard to this value.

## Release 2.15.2

### admin

A fix of a bug which caused the `set breakeven`  command not to accept zero.

### chimera

Fix a regression causing directories to inherit ACLs as if they were files rather than directories. Soon we will provide a procedure to clean-up already existing wrongly inherited directories.

### ftp

Several problems with restrictions are fixed.
### pnfsmanager

Directory items with the restriction preventing READ_METADATA activity were not omitted in a directory listing. 
This is now fixed.

### srm

Previous version of dCache could not reload information about previous or ongoing SRM transactions; this prevented the ls command from functioning and prevented SRM from starting if there were ongoing activity when dCache was shut down. This is now fixed.

## Release 2.15.1

### ftp

On very short transfers, two internal messages could occasionally arrive in the wrong order. This would cause clients to see the "226 Transfer complete." message without the "150 Opening BINARY data connection for" immediate reply. This rare issue is now fixed.
### pnfsmanager

Billing entries for SRM uploads recently lost the storage class part of the entry. This update fixes that issue.
We observed an error caused by the parallel execution of two uploads, both trying to create the same (previously non-existing) directory). This modification fixes the underlying race condition, allowing such transfers to succeed.
### pool

Fixed a regression introduced in 2.13 in which internal options like -c:puts were erroneously included to the call out to the HSM script.
### poolmanager

This modification fixes a race condition in pool manager that could theoretically have provided erroneous data to pin manager, space manager, srm, xrootd and webdav.
The pool selection unit allows multiple links with different priorities to be defined. By default, fallback to a lower priority link is only allowed when pools with higher priority links are inaccessible. For read an option exists to allow fallback on high load too, but until now, there was no option to fallback on write when target pools have no free space.
Pool manager wass partitions now support the -fallback-onspace option to enable fallback to lower priority links when all available pools in higher priority links are full.
### srm

When writing to a path /a/b/c, if b exists and is a file, SRM currently returns SRM_INTERNAL_ERROR. This modification changes that behaviour so that the more appropriate status SRM_INVALID_PATH is returned.
During SRM-based operations, some sites reported problems with the delegation of user credentials. This modification remedies those problems, while at the same time reducing the CPU usage of establishing 3rd-party SRM connections.

## Release 2.15.0


#### Glob patterns gain alternation lists

Adds support for `{}` alternation lists in many places were globs are
supported. I.e. `1{foo,bar}2` matches both `1foo2` and
`1bar2`. Alternation lists can be nested. Among others these are used
for matching pool names in pool manager, admin shell and migration
module, patterns for file name matching in directory listings, and in
gPlazma.

#### Cell communication gets fail fast path on overload

dCache services communicate through message passing. For request-reply
style interactions messages have a time to live field. If messages are
delivered late due to overload, messages are discarded to avoid
inducing even more load on the receiving service. When this happens
the requesting service will wait for the reply until the request times
out and thus an overloaded system will give the appearance to hang.

This release adds a fail fast path in the receiving service in which
it immediately generates a timeout reply if the expected queuing time
exceeds the time to live of the message. Thus with this release
services may generate timeout responses quickly when another service
approaches an overload situation.

#### Cell message thread pool configuration is harmonized

dCache services communicate through message passing. Messages are
delivered to a service from a pool of threads. For some services, the
number of threads and the maximum message queue length are
configurable. Keeping with dCache tradition, the configuration
properties were different for different services. Trying to establish
a new tradition, these properties have now been harmonized.

The following are the relevant configuration properties (copied verbatim from
the default property files).


    #  ---- Maximum number of concurrent requests to process.
    #
    #  The number of login requests that gPlazma will process
    #  concurrently.  Setting this number too high may result in large
    #  spikes of CPU activity and the potential to run out of memory.
    #  Setting the number too lower results in potentially slow login
    #  activity.
    #
    (deprecated)gplazma.cell.limits.threads=30
    gplazma.cell.max-message-threads=${gplazma.cell.limits.threads}

    #  ---- Maximum number of requests to queue.
    #
    #  The number of login requests that gPlazma will queue before
    #  rejecting requests. Unlimited if left empty.
    #
    gplazma.cell.max-messages-queued=


    #
    # NFS door message processing thread pool configuration
    #
    (deprecated)nfs.cell.limits.message.threads.max=8
    (deprecated)nfs.cell.limits.message.queue.max=1000
    nfs.cell.max-message-threads=${nfs.cell.limits.message.threads.max}
    nfs.cell.max-messages-queued=${nfs.cell.limits.message.queue.max}

    #  ---- Cell message processing parameters
    #
    #  Settings for the request processing thread pool.
    #
    #  The thread pool will stay at the minimum number of threads until the
    #  maximum request queue length has been reached. At that point the number
    #  of threads is increased up to the maximum, after which further requests
    #  will be dropped. Idle threads are terminated after the idle time until
    #  the number of threads drops back to the minimum.
    #
    #  Except for database operations, the pin manager operates in an
    #  asynchronous fashion. The minimum number of threads should be chosen
    #  such that the database can be saturated under load. If network latency
    #  between the pin manager and the database is high, then the minimum
    #  number of threads could be increased to hide this latency. The default
    #  setting is likely fine for most cases.
    #
    #  The maximum number of threads should be below the database connection
    #  limit - otherwise threads end up blocking for idle connections and may
    #  potentially deadlock in case the same thread needs more than one
    #  connection (e.g. for nested transactions).

    srm.cell.max-messages-queued = ${srm.cell.limits.message.queue.max}


#### Several obsolete admin shell commands are dropped

The following deprecated admin shell commands have been removed or
marked obsolete: `load cellprinter`, `load interpreter`, `set
classloader`, and `show classloader`. If you used these (you didn't)
then stop doing so.

#### Chimera gets new compact primary key

The Chimera database schema has been heavily updated. The schema has
traditionally used the variable length and relatively long PNFS ID as
a primary and foreign key. In this release a 64 bit inumber is
introduced to replace the PNFS ID as a key in the schema. The PNFS ID
is still an essential concept to dCache as it is used as a persistent
identifier for files on pools, however in Chimera it is just another
file attribute.

Upon upgrade all Chimera tables will be rewritten. One has to expect
that for large instances the schema update will take many hours. We
recommend testing the schema migration on a clone of the database
prior to deploying dCache 2.15. The schema can be rolled back to the
previous structure using the `dcache database rollbackToDate` command,
but this must be done before downgrading dCache.

Custom Chimera queries and views will likely have to be updated. If
custom views or triggers have been installed, we recommend extra
attention to testing the migration prior to upgrade to ensure that the
custom modifications do not cause the upgrade to fail.


The new schema uses less disk space which means more data can be
cached in available memory on the RDBMS server. Depending on hardware,
this may provide a significant performance improvement. On the other
hand, hardware with plenty of RAM and SSDs may only observe a minor
improvement.


#### Chimera can store several checksums for a file

Chimera can now store several checksums of different types for a file.

#### Chimera performs consistency check upon upgrade

Previous dCache releases have fixed several bugs in Chimera. These
bugs may however have introduced inconsistencies such as wrong link
counts or unlinked files.

Upon upgrade, the Chimera schema migration will fix these
inconsistencies. It will create a `lost+found` directory in the root
of the name space and link unreachable files and directories from
here. After upgrade the content should be inspected and either deleted
or moved out of the `lost+found` directory. Running this consistency
check takes significant time and is one of the reasons why the Chimera
schema upgrade in this release is time consuming. The check cannot be
triggered manually. The inconsistencies observed were caused by bugs
that should be fixed now. If they are not, that's a bug.


#### Admin shell commands gain better documentation

Many admin shell commands have been updated with additional
documentation. Most commands should be functionally
unchanged. Affected services are `cleaner`, `dir`, `pool`,
`pnfsmanager`, and `poolmanager`.


#### gPlazma gains new feature to restrict file access

gPlazma plugins now have access to a new powerful abstraction called a
_restriction_. A restriction is invoked upon any name space operation
and the restriction can block the access. dCache itself currently uses
restrictions to implement read-only accounts, but third party session
plugins can generate custom restrictions as part of a client login.

Developers should consult the JavaDoc of the [Restriction class]
(https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/common/src/main/java/org/dcache/auth/attributes/Restriction.java)
and contact the dCache team.


#### DCAP can accept ACLs on file or directory creation

At dCache.org we love standards, but DCAP is still around and utilized
by many users. Some of those users like to use ACLs too, and this
release adds support for specifying ACLs when creating files or
directories. Programmatically this can be done like so:

    dc_setExtraOpotion("-acl=\"<ace1> ... <aceN>\"");

From the command line you would do something like:

    dccp -X-acl="\"A::3750:rwatTnNcCoy A::EVERYONE@:rtncy\"" .....

The first one to decipher that ACE without consulting the
documentation gets a free license!


#### FTP AUTH return codes are now RFC 2228 compliant

Return codes for error results of the AUTH command have been changed
to be more in compliance with RFC 2228. In the unlikely event that
your client relied on dCache not being compliant with RFC 2228,
your client is now broken.

#### gPlazma produces better diagnostic information

Proxy certificates include an embedded attribute certificate when they
are a voms proxy.  This attribute certificate contains group-membership
information and is signed by the VOMS server's credential.

An `.lsc` file associates a trusted VOMS server with some already
trusted certificate authority.  This requires that the CA that signed
the VOMS server's certificate matches the DN in the `.lsc` file,
otherwise the VOMS server is not trusted and no FQANs are extracted.
Therefore, when diagnosing a problem where the voms plugin fails to
extract any FQANs it is sometimes useful to know which CA signed the
VOMS server's certificate.

This release extends the output logged upon failure to login and by
the gPlazma `explain login` command to show the attribute certificate
extensions.  One VOMS-specific extension includes the certificate
chain of the VOMS server.  With this release, the various issuers of
this chain are shown.

Additionally, the output of the DN of the VOMS certificate is updated
to RFC 2253 format. Yay standards!


#### gPlazma authdb can be sufficient

gPlazma uses a PAM style structure with plugins being marked
`optional`, `sufficient`, `required` or `prerequisite`. `sufficient`
indicates that if a plugin succeeds then that is sufficient (a very
descriptive name, it seems) to complete the current phase. For this to
work it requires that a plugin can fail too - otherwise it would
always be sufficient.

`authzdb` was a plugin that would not fail in the session phase if no
session information was found - now it does.

#### Pool `rep ls` command gains filter on storage info

The `rep ls` admin shell command lists the files on a pool. It now
accepts the `-storage` option to filter by storage class and thus list
only a subset of the files. The option even accepts a glob pattern.

#### Pool startup has been improved

The pool startup logic has been heavily refactored in this release. A
pool will now immediately switch to read-only mode when it
starts. Like before, the pool will remain read-only until a full
inventory has been build and any inconsistencies have been
addressed.

Lock contention during pool initialization has been reduced. In
particular this avoids a period of unresponsiveness just prior to
switching to read-write mode.


#### NFS becomes more robust against mover timeouts

If the NFS door times out while waiting for a write mover to be
activated, it would retry the creation and erroneously create a read
mover instead. It no longer does this.


#### ANONYMOUS and AUTHENTICATED ACEs gain consistent semantics

ANONYMOUS and AUTHENTICATED ACEs in name space ACLs in previous
releases was inconsistent and erroneous and in some situations both
ACEs were applied simultaneously despite RFC 3530 stating that they
are mutually exclusive. The interpretation is now no longer erroneous
nor inconsistent.



#### SRM `info` command provides cache statistics

The SRM maintains several internal caches. Statistics about the
awesome effectiveness of these caches are now included in the output
of the `info` admin shell command:

    --- storage (dCache plugin for SRM) ---
    Custom reverse DNS lookup cache: CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0}
    Space token by owner cache: CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0}
    Space by token cache: CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0}


#### Admin shell gets configurable history length

The admin shell can store a persistent command history. This release
increases the default and adds a configuration property for how many
commands to store. Gone are the days of forgetting that brilliant
one-liner.


    #  ---- Admin door history size
    #
    #   The size of the history in lines and thereby the history can be
    #   limited by setting admin.history.size to an integer value. The
    #   standard size is 500.
    #
    admin.history.size = 500



#### gPlazma produces better log messages for VOMS failures

FQANs in a VOMS proxy are only trusted if signed by a VOMS server for
which an `.lsc` file is present. Other FQANs are silently dropped (you
don't want to reject a user just because he signed up with an unknown
VOMS server). In previous releases it was really hard to distinguish
the situation in which a user didn't have any VOMS extensions in the
certificate or if they had all been rejected due to validation
failures. It was also really hard to know why validation failed. This
is now really easy as gPlazma logs this information to the log file.

#### WebDAV logs `X-Forwarded-For` header to reveal clients behind proxies

The WebDAV door produces an access log detailing who has been using it
and how. Among the information logged is the client IP address,
however if a user cowardly hides behind a proxy only the proxy's IP
address was logged. Now the WebDAV door logs the client IP address as
reported by the proxy, too. Obviously, this information is only as
trustworthy as the proxy.

#### Enforce source address in proxy certificates

An X.509 proxy certificate is a certificate signed by an end user
certificate or another proxy certificate. Whoever got the proxy
certificate can act upon the original end user's behalf. The proxy can
however be limited in various ways. One of these is by adding a policy
element that restricts from which IP addresses the certificate can be
used. Whoever got the proxy can still do bad things, but at least we
limit them to doing it from a particular node. In the past dCache
ignored this optional policy - now it no longer does.



#### gPlazma xacml plugin uses updated XACML client library

The `xacml` gPlazma plugin integrates dCache with GUMS serves. The
plugin relies on a third party XACML client library. In this release
we upgraded that library to a new version with awesome new
features. Among other things it no longer relies on JGlobus, which
means dCache 2.15 is the first release in decades without JGlobus
(yay!). It also understands HTTP keep alive now, so we don't have to
reconnect to the GUMS server all the time.

To not just make this about hidden internal things, we obsoleted two
configuration properties and introduced a new one:

    #  ---- Path to the vomsdir directory
    gplazma.xacml.vomsdir=${dcache.authn.vomsdir}
    (obsolete)gplazma.xacml.vomsdir.dir = Use gplazma.xacml.vomsdir
    (obsolete)gplazma.xacml.vomsdir.ca = Use gplazma.xacml.ca
