## Executive summary

Highlights from this release:

* Improved glob patterns.
* More robust handling of over load situations.
* fsck for Chimera on upgrade.
* Reduced storage requirements for Chimera.
* Chimera can store multiple checksum for a file.
* Admin shell documentation updates.
* gPlazma restriction attributes.
* Set ACLs through DCAP.
* Pool startup improvements.

## Incompatibilities

* Some configuration properties have been deprecated or made
  obsolete. `dcache check-config` can tell you if you are affected.
* Several Chimera schema changes are applied upon upgrade. To
  downgrade those schema changes have to be rolled back prior to
  downgrade.
* Several bugs have been fixed. In the unlikely event that you
  relied on these bugs, upgrading may break your installation.
* X.509 proxy certificate source address restrictions are now
  enforced. Clients that relied on these not being enforced will
  fail after upgrade.

## Release 2.15.4

### doors

Fixes a bug in which a host name set in `*.net.listen properties` was not preserved
when publishing a door or generating SURLs.

### Changes affecting multiple services

When building rpm files a package `which` is now explicitly required as a dependency.

### cells

This change fixes a bug in routing manager that would leave orphaned topic routes in
dCache domain.

### pool

The nearline storage subsystem has a thread pool for various tasks. Some
of these tasks are blocking. Since the
thread pool is unlimited, a high inflow of new requests can cause the
thread pool to grow rapidly and even exceed thread limitations. In that
case the pool dies.
In the current release a new `pool.limits.nearline-threads` property is introduced 
which allow to limit the number of threads used by the nearline storage subsystem. Note that, the default is
30 threads.

## Release 2.15.3

### cells

LoginManager would occasionally generate error messages similar to "Discarding listening on $LOCATION 53684' because its age of 18721640 ms exceeds its time to live of 4500 ms.". This was due to erroneous reuse of old message envelopes in the internal messaging. This change fixes that problem.

This change addresses a potential problem in which messages sent between cells in the same domain could appear older than they are and thus would risk being discarded due to the time-to-live being expired.

Contains corrections to cells logging. The routing manager pinboard now shows information previously logged to various other cells.

### srm

A Tier-1 site reported problems with a major WLCG VO's read requests. Investigating the source of the problems showed that the srm_ifce library, used by the (outdated) GFAL v1 and the (supported) GFAL v2 SRM libraries, drastically limits the permitted lifetime of requests without providing admins any way to configure this. 

For sites seeing errors related to desiredTotalRequestTime being exceeded, this change provides the new configuration option srm.request.maximum-client-assumed-bandwidth in srm.properties as a work-around. 

Sites not observing such errors do not need to change anything with regard to this value.

## Release 2.15.2

### admin

A fix of a bug which caused the `set breakeven`  command not to accept zero.

### chimera

Fix a regression causing directories to inherit ACLs as if they were files rather than directories. Soon we will provide a procedure to clean-up already existing wrongly inherited directories.

### ftp

Several problems with restrictions are fixed.
### pnfsmanager

Directory items with the restriction preventing READ_METADATA activity were not omitted in a directory listing. 
This is now fixed.

### srm

Previous version of dCache could not reload information about previous or ongoing SRM transactions; this prevented the ls command from functioning and prevented SRM from starting if there were ongoing activity when dCache was shut down. This is now fixed.

## Release 2.15.1

### ftp

On very short transfers, two internal messages could occasionally arrive in the wrong order. This would cause clients to see the "226 Transfer complete." message without the "150 Opening BINARY data connection for" immediate reply. This rare issue is now fixed.
### pnfsmanager

Billing entries for SRM uploads recently lost the storage class part of the entry. This update fixes that issue.
We observed an error caused by the parallel execution of two uploads, both trying to create the same (previously non-existing) directory). This modification fixes the underlying race condition, allowing such transfers to succeed.
### pool

Fixed a regression introduced in 2.13 in which internal options like -c:puts were erroneously included to the call out to the HSM script.
### poolmanager

This modification fixes a race condition in pool manager that could theoretically have provided erroneous data to pin manager, space manager, srm, xrootd and webdav.
The pool selection unit allows multiple links with different priorities to be defined. By default, fallback to a lower priority link is only allowed when pools with higher priority links are inaccessible. For read an option exists to allow fallback on high load too, but until now, there was no option to fallback on write when target pools have no free space.
Pool manager wass partitions now support the -fallback-onspace option to enable fallback to lower priority links when all available pools in higher priority links are full.
### srm

When writing to a path /a/b/c, if b exists and is a file, SRM currently returns SRM_INTERNAL_ERROR. This modification changes that behaviour so that the more appropriate status SRM_INVALID_PATH is returned.
During SRM-based operations, some sites reported problems with the delegation of user credentials. This modification remedies those problems, while at the same time reducing the CPU usage of establishing 3rd-party SRM connections.

## Release 2.15.0


#### Glob patterns gain alternation lists

Adds support for `{}` alternation lists in many places were globs are
supported. I.e. `1{foo,bar}2` matches both `1foo2` and
`1bar2`. Alternation lists can be nested. Among others these are used
for matching pool names in pool manager, admin shell and migration
module, patterns for file name matching in directory listings, and in
gPlazma.

#### Cell communication gets fail fast path on overload

dCache services communicate through message passing. For request-reply
style interactions messages have a time to live field. If messages are
delivered late due to overload, messages are discarded to avoid
inducing even more load on the receiving service. When this happens
the requesting service will wait for the reply until the request times
out and thus an overloaded system will give the appearance to hang.

This release adds a fail fast path in the receiving service in which
it immediately generates a timeout reply if the expected queuing time
exceeds the time to live of the message. Thus with this release
services may generate timeout responses quickly when another service
approaches an overload situation.

#### Cell message thread pool configuration is harmonized

dCache services communicate through message passing. Messages are
delivered to a service from a pool of threads. For some services, the
number of threads and the maximum message queue length are
configurable. Keeping with dCache tradition, the configuration
properties were different for different services. Trying to establish
a new tradition, these properties have now been harmonized.

The following are the relevant configuration properties (copied verbatim from
the default property files).


    #  ---- Maximum number of concurrent requests to process.
    #
    #  The number of login requests that gPlazma will process
    #  concurrently.  Setting this number too high may result in large
    #  spikes of CPU activity and the potential to run out of memory.
    #  Setting the number too lower results in potentially slow login
    #  activity.
    #
    (deprecated)gplazma.cell.limits.threads=30
    gplazma.cell.max-message-threads=${gplazma.cell.limits.threads}

    #  ---- Maximum number of requests to queue.
    #
    #  The number of login requests that gPlazma will queue before
    #  rejecting requests. Unlimited if left empty.
    #
    gplazma.cell.max-messages-queued=


    #
    # NFS door message processing thread pool configuration
    #
    (deprecated)nfs.cell.limits.message.threads.max=8
    (deprecated)nfs.cell.limits.message.queue.max=1000
    nfs.cell.max-message-threads=${nfs.cell.limits.message.threads.max}
    nfs.cell.max-messages-queued=${nfs.cell.limits.message.queue.max}

    #  ---- Cell message processing parameters
    #
    #  Settings for the request processing thread pool.
    #
    #  The thread pool will stay at the minimum number of threads until the
    #  maximum request queue length has been reached. At that point the number
    #  of threads is increased up to the maximum, after which further requests
    #  will be dropped. Idle threads are terminated after the idle time until
    #  the number of threads drops back to the minimum.
    #
    #  Except for database operations, the pin manager operates in an
    #  asynchronous fashion. The minimum number of threads should be chosen
    #  such that the database can be saturated under load. If network latency
    #  between the pin manager and the database is high, then the minimum
    #  number of threads could be increased to hide this latency. The default
    #  setting is likely fine for most cases.
    #
    #  The maximum number of threads should be below the database connection
    #  limit - otherwise threads end up blocking for idle connections and may
    #  potentially deadlock in case the same thread needs more than one
    #  connection (e.g. for nested transactions).

    srm.cell.max-message-threads = ${srm.cell.limits.message.threads.max}
    srm.cell.max-messages-queued = ${srm.cell.limits.message.queue.max}


#### Several obsolete admin shell commands are dropped

The following deprecated admin shell commands have been removed or
marked obsolete: `load cellprinter`, `load interpreter`, `set
classloader`, and `show classloader`. If you used these (you didn't)
then stop doing so.

#### Chimera gets new compact primary key

The Chimera database schema has been heavily updated. The schema has
traditionally used the variable length and relatively long PNFS ID as
a primary and foreign key. In this release a 64 bit inumber is
introduced to replace the PNFS ID as a key in the schema. The PNFS ID
is still an essential concept to dCache as it is used as a persistent
identifier for files on pools, however in Chimera it is just another
file attribute.

Upon upgrade all Chimera tables will be rewritten. One has to expect
that for large instances the schema update will take many hours. We
recommend testing the schema migration on a clone of the database
prior to deploying dCache 2.15. The schema can be rolled back to the
previous structure using the `dcache database rollbackToDate` command,
but this must be done before downgrading dCache.

Custom Chimera queries and views will likely have to be updated. If
custom views or triggers have been installed, we recommend extra
attention to testing the migration prior to upgrade to ensure that the
custom modifications do not cause the upgrade to fail.


The new schema uses less disk space which means more data can be
cached in available memory on the RDBMS server. Depending on hardware,
this may provide a significant performance improvement. On the other
hand, hardware with plenty of RAM and SSDs may only observe a minor
improvement.


#### Chimera can store several checksums for a file

Chimera can now store several checksums of different types for a file.

#### Chimera performs consistency check upon upgrade

Previous dCache releases have fixed several bugs in Chimera. These
bugs may however have introduced inconsistencies such as wrong link
counts or unlinked files.

Upon upgrade, the Chimera schema migration will fix these
inconsistencies. It will create a `lost+found` directory in the root
of the name space and link unreachable files and directories from
here. After upgrade the content should be inspected and either deleted
or moved out of the `lost+found` directory. Running this consistency
check takes significant time and is one of the reasons why the Chimera
schema upgrade in this release is time consuming. The check cannot be
triggered manually. The inconsistencies observed were caused by bugs
that should be fixed now. If they are not, that's a bug.


#### Admin shell commands gain better documentation

Many admin shell commands have been updated with additional
documentation. Most commands should be functionally
unchanged. Affected services are `cleaner`, `dir`, `pool`,
`pnfsmanager`, and `poolmanager`.


#### gPlazma gains new feature to restrict file access

gPlazma plugins now have access to a new powerful abstraction called a
_restriction_. A restriction is invoked upon any name space operation
and the restriction can block the access. dCache itself currently uses
restrictions to implement read-only accounts, but third party session
plugins can generate custom restrictions as part of a client login.

Developers should consult the JavaDoc of the [Restriction class]
(https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/common/src/main/java/org/dcache/auth/attributes/Restriction.java)
and contact the dCache team.


#### DCAP can accept ACLs on file or directory creation

At dCache.org we love standards, but DCAP is still around and utilized
by many users. Some of those users like to use ACLs too, and this
release adds support for specifying ACLs when creating files or
directories. Programmatically this can be done like so:

    dc_setExtraOpotion("-acl=\"<ace1> ... <aceN>\"");

From the command line you would do something like:

    dccp -X-acl="\"A::3750:rwatTnNcCoy A::EVERYONE@:rtncy\"" .....

The first one to decipher that ACE without consulting the
documentation gets a free license!


#### FTP AUTH return codes are now RFC 2228 compliant

Return codes for error results of the AUTH command have been changed
to be more in compliance with RFC 2228. In the unlikely event that
your client relied on dCache not being compliant with RFC 2228,
your client is now broken.

#### gPlazma produces better diagnostic information

Proxy certificates include an embedded attribute certificate when they
are a voms proxy.  This attribute certificate contains group-membership
information and is signed by the VOMS server's credential.

An `.lsc` file associates a trusted VOMS server with some already
trusted certificate authority.  This requires that the CA that signed
the VOMS server's certificate matches the DN in the `.lsc` file,
otherwise the VOMS server is not trusted and no FQANs are extracted.
Therefore, when diagnosing a problem where the voms plugin fails to
extract any FQANs it is sometimes useful to know which CA signed the
VOMS server's certificate.

This release extends the output logged upon failure to login and by
the gPlazma `explain login` command to show the attribute certificate
extensions.  One VOMS-specific extension includes the certificate
chain of the VOMS server.  With this release, the various issuers of
this chain are shown.

Additionally, the output of the DN of the VOMS certificate is updated
to RFC 2253 format. Yay standards!


#### gPlazma authdb can be sufficient

gPlazma uses a PAM style structure with plugins being marked
`optional`, `sufficient`, `required` or `prerequisite`. `sufficient`
indicates that if a plugin succeeds then that is sufficient (a very
descriptive name, it seems) to complete the current phase. For this to
work it requires that a plugin can fail too - otherwise it would
always be sufficient.

`authzdb` was a plugin that would not fail in the session phase if no
session information was found - now it does.

#### Pool `rep ls` command gains filter on storage info

The `rep ls` admin shell command lists the files on a pool. It now
accepts the `-storage` option to filter by storage class and thus list
only a subset of the files. The option even accepts a glob pattern.

#### Pool startup has been improved

The pool startup logic has been heavily refactored in this release. A
pool will now immediately switch to read-only mode when it
starts. Like before, the pool will remain read-only until a full
inventory has been build and any inconsistencies have been
addressed.

Lock contention during pool initialization has been reduced. In
particular this avoids a period of unresponsiveness just prior to
switching to read-write mode.


#### NFS becomes more robust against mover timeouts

If the NFS door times out while waiting for a write mover to be
activated, it would retry the creation and erroneously create a read
mover instead. It no longer does this.


#### ANONYMOUS and AUTHENTICATED ACEs gain consistent semantics

ANONYMOUS and AUTHENTICATED ACEs in name space ACLs in previous
releases was inconsistent and erroneous and in some situations both
ACEs were applied simultaneously despite RFC 3530 stating that they
are mutually exclusive. The interpretation is now no longer erroneous
nor inconsistent.



#### SRM `info` command provides cache statistics

The SRM maintains several internal caches. Statistics about the
awesome effectiveness of these caches are now included in the output
of the `info` admin shell command:

    --- storage (dCache plugin for SRM) ---
    Custom reverse DNS lookup cache: CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0}
    Space token by owner cache: CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0}
    Space by token cache: CacheStats{hitCount=0, missCount=0, loadSuccessCount=0, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=0, evictionCount=0}


#### Admin shell gets configurable history length

The admin shell can store a persistent command history. This release
increases the default and adds a configuration property for how many
commands to store. Gone are the days of forgetting that brilliant
one-liner.


    #  ---- Admin door history size
    #
    #   The size of the history in lines and thereby the history can be
    #   limited by setting admin.history.size to an integer value. The
    #   standard size is 500.
    #
    admin.history.size = 500



#### gPlazma produces better log messages for VOMS failures

FQANs in a VOMS proxy are only trusted if signed by a VOMS server for
which an `.lsc` file is present. Other FQANs are silently dropped (you
don't want to reject a user just because he signed up with an unknown
VOMS server). In previous releases it was really hard to distinguish
the situation in which a user didn't have any VOMS extensions in the
certificate or if they had all been rejected due to validation
failures. It was also really hard to know why validation failed. This
is now really easy as gPlazma logs this information to the log file.

#### WebDAV logs `X-Forwarded-For` header to reveal clients behind proxies

The WebDAV door produces an access log detailing who has been using it
and how. Among the information logged is the client IP address,
however if a user cowardly hides behind a proxy only the proxy's IP
address was logged. Now the WebDAV door logs the client IP address as
reported by the proxy, too. Obviously, this information is only as
trustworthy as the proxy.

#### Enforce source address in proxy certificates

An X.509 proxy certificate is a certificate signed by an end user
certificate or another proxy certificate. Whoever got the proxy
certificate can act upon the original end user's behalf. The proxy can
however be limited in various ways. One of these is by adding a policy
element that restricts from which IP addresses the certificate can be
used. Whoever got the proxy can still do bad things, but at least we
limit them to doing it from a particular node. In the past dCache
ignored this optional policy - now it no longer does.



#### gPlazma xacml plugin uses updated XACML client library

The `xacml` gPlazma plugin integrates dCache with GUMS serves. The
plugin relies on a third party XACML client library. In this release
we upgraded that library to a new version with awesome new
features. Among other things it no longer relies on JGlobus, which
means dCache 2.15 is the first release in decades without JGlobus
(yay!). It also understands HTTP keep alive now, so we don't have to
reconnect to the GUMS server all the time.

To not just make this about hidden internal things, we obsoleted two
configuration properties and introduced a new one:

    #  ---- Path to the vomsdir directory
    gplazma.xacml.vomsdir=${dcache.authn.vomsdir}
    (obsolete)gplazma.xacml.vomsdir.dir = Use gplazma.xacml.vomsdir
    (obsolete)gplazma.xacml.vomsdir.ca = Use gplazma.xacml.ca
