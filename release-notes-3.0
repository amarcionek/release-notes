## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Onno Zweers for several contributions to this release.

## Release 3.0.6

### cells

Fixed a race condition and logging bug affecting cells relying on zookeeper. This
could affect location manager, space manager and pool manager.

### gplazma-ldap

Wrong quoting of two gplazma property strings could occasionally cause IllegalArgumentExceptions to be thrown when using LDAP-based logins. This problem has now been fixed.

### locationmanager

Fixed a problem in Location Manager in which it would fail to shut down
and could leave two overlapping connectors running.

### pool

The process of deleting files on pools has been made more robust against potential problems. This further decreased the likelyhood of repository corruption during file deletion.

This release improves transactional stability of the built-in Berkeley database in pools.

### srmclient

SRM Client v1 received improved error handling. Most noticeably, expired credentials no longer cause a RuntimeException but an IOException.

## Release 3.0.4

### dcache

The current release updated dcache-view version.

### pool

In the current release changes  `hsm ls` command so that it lists all configured HSMs if no argument is provided.

The current release fixed URISyntaxException in ceph backend.

### poolmanager

Ability to restrict staging to specific protocol was missing in
stage protection specification. Additionally it was not possible to
specify DN, FQAN, storage group and protocol that are not allowed
to stage.  

This is now fixed and stage protection configuration can be used as a blacklist.

## Release 3.0.3

### cells

The current release fixed an issue causing doors to log a  stack trace on startup.

### nfs

Remote I/O error was generated on the client side accompanied by stack trace on server side when user fumbled .(get) command.
The is fixed now and  client side sees no such file or directory error and no stack trace in log file.

### srmclient

The current release fixed out of memory  issue for  `srmls -l`
 showing particular directory. 

### srm-common

The current release improved  user experience by ensuring that bugs and JVM-critical errors 
do not trigger a retry of the operation, but favour a fail-fast approach.

### transfermanager

The output of `info`, `queue`, `ls internal` and `ls external` admin
commands in RemoteTransferManager has been improved.

## Release 3.0.2

### cleaner

Users reported that they wanted to see space freed up by cleaner processes
to be reported as free as soon as possible. This patch sends notifications
about freed up space more often, resulting in quicker status updates.

### doors

Log when the list of auto-discovered NIC interfaces changes.  Support
logging the time taken to acquire NIC information.  Update logged
messages to indicate the context.

### nfs

The NFS implementation was updated, improving spec compliance.

### pool

A problem was fixed that could cause the csm check to fail on pools 
containing broken files.

When deleting files, the cleaner submits batches of files to delete to a pool,
but this batch is then processed sequentially. In order to improve deletion
performance, such deletion tasks are now run concurrently. The
increase in concurrency can reduce the overhead of syncing the meta data to
disk after every deletion, thus increasing the deletion rate.

### srmclient

While srmfs's '-debug' option already provided lots of information, 
including the SOAP request sent to the server, it did not provide 
the server's response until now. This has been added, making 
troubleshooting easier for some problem classes.

The SRM client has been updated to work correctly if it has been
installed in a path containing spaces.

Glob expansion in SRM client has been overhauled, allowing much faster namespace operations on DPM when globbing is in use.

srmfs would not work with paths that require special characters to be percent-encoded.
This included path names with spaces or hash symbols. After this update to srmfs,
such path names are permissible and all namespace operations and file transfers on them 
will succeed.

srmfs now accepts single commands directly as command-line arguments, e.g.
'srmfs srm://srm.example.org/path ls'

Exiting will block if there are ongoing transfers.  Notifications are
printed, which should provide feedback on activity.

The user can force an exit by using Ctrl+C, which will still result in a
clean exit.

## Release 3.0.1


### cells

The current release improves reply handling in batch processing.

### ftpclient

The current release improves compatibility between dCache FTP client and Globus GridFTP
server.

The dCache GridFTP client was  not working with Globus FTP server. This is now fixed.

### pool

The current release introduces a new pool.mover.nfs.thread-policy property, which add a spossibility to control  
nfs request processing policies. 
dCache admins could choose  one of the  strategies for nfs request processing.  
Please note, that by default the request processing policy is set to same-thtead strategy.

### srmclient

`srmfs` was issuing `SRM` requests that `DPM` did not accept. `srmfs`
also did not accept the responses from DPM. This was preventing any file
transfers for succeeding. 
This is now fixed and srmPrepareToGet and srmStatusOfGetRequest operations work as expected with DPM.

The two `ls` commands (`lls` and `ls`) was not supporting multiple
arguments or glob expansion. Both were taking an optional, single
argument, which was  limiting while discovering what content is
available and was not matching the expectation of the users.
The current releases fixes this limitation and  Multiple arguments and glob expansion are now supported for the `ls` and `lls` commands.

Correct information displayed about directories from DPM.

This release of dCache improves the readability of the error returned to the client when server declines to add an explanation.

## Release 3.0.0

The most obvious change is the transition to a new versioning scheme
that better reflects our existing release and compatibility policy.

Once a year, dCache.org releases a golden release. The golden release
maintains compatibility with pools of the previous golden release and
any intermediate version. The release after the golden release drops
compatibility with pools older than the golden release it surpasses.
The new versioning scheme reflects the incompatibility by incrementing
the major version number in the release *after* a golden release. Thus
the golden release marks the last release of a particular major
version. Like before, patch level releases are identified by a third
number in the version.

As always, this dCache release contains many internal changes, many
performance improvements and many cosmetic changes that will not be
explicitly described in the release notes. The changelog at the end
contains the complete list.

As always in a release after a golden release (an .0 release in the
new versioning scheme), configuration properties previously marked
obsolete have been dropped. Configuration properties previously marked
deprecated are now obsolete. You should run `dcache check-config`
before upgrading and fix any warnings. Rerun `dcache check-config`
after upgrading.

The following are noteworthy changes or changes that you as an admin
should know about when upgrading. The changes are described in no
particular order.

#### admin: no longer supports DSA keys

Upon upgrade, the post installation script will automatically generate
RSA keys instead. Your ssh client may warn you about the changed
server key. The `admin.paths.dsa-host-key.private` and
`admin.paths.dsa-host-key.public` properties are obsolete.

#### Automatic detection of current PostgreSQL master

`dcache.db.host` and derived properties now accept a comma separated
list of host names when used with PostgreSQL. This is intended for use
with a cluster of PostgreSQL servers using streaming replication. The
JDBC driver automatically detects and uses the current master
server. In case a slave is promoted to master, the JDBC driver
automatically discovers and reconnects to the new master without
requiring a dCache restart.

#### caNl 2.1

Although this change should be transparent, the update of the Common
Authentication Library, the Bouncy Castle cryptographic library, the
ARGUS library, and the VOMS library is critical and you never
know if this breaks something. Keep an eye out for CA and client
problems.

On the positive side, this upgrade allowed us to update the Apache
SSHD library which hopefully fixes a number of compatibility problems
observed with some Python SSH libraries.


#### billing: empty format strings suppresses output

Previously, if a formatting string was undefined, billing records would
be logged using a default format. This has been changed such that
billing records with an undefined or empty formatting string are not
added to the billing file. This allows specific record types to be
suppressed.

#### billing: make billing files self-describing

Upon startup or when rolling over to a new billing file, the billing
service now outputs formatting instructions to the billing file. These
are lines starting with `##` followed by the message type and the
configured formatting string.  Parsers may make use of the
instructions to recognize the format. At the very least, third party
parsers should be updated to ignore lines starting with a hash symbol.


The billing indexing utility has been updated to recognize these
formatting instructions and thus can parse the billing files even when
the output format is changed and billing files thus contain a mix of
different formats.

Configuration properties with the common prefix
`billing.parser.format` were added to define the default format for
old billing files without formatting instructions. Thus the output
format can be changed while still maintaining compatibility with old
billing files.

#### billing: expose full address in billing record

Previously, some billing records were logged with a full cell address
while others only included a cell name. The default format retains
this behaviour, however the full cell address is now exposed in the
formatting string. The cell name and domain name are also exposed
separately, making it possible to output these as separate
fields. Check the instructions in `billing.properties` for details.

#### billing: make service replicable

It is now possible to add multiple billing services if all components
(including pools) have been updated to version 3.0. All instances of
`billing` receive all billing records.

Introduced `dcache.queue.billing` and `dcache.topic.billing`
properties and marked `dcache.service.billing` obsolete.

#### Setup files are now restricted to setup commands

The setup files of various services, in particular `poolmanager.conf`
and `setup` on pools, are now restricted to setup commands. These are
the commands the services themselves use when generating the setup
files. Previously any cell command could be included, even though the
command would be lost when the setup file was regenerated.


#### Setup file syntax is now checked before it is loaded

When reloading a setup file at runtime using the `reload` command, the
file is now checked for syntactic errors before being applied to the
running service. If an error is found, the file is not loaded and the
service is unaffected. Previously, such errors would leave the service
in an inoperable state.


#### Legacy cell topology support has been dropped

dCache 2.16 introduced the use of ZooKeeper for topology discovery as
well as the use of core domains as message brokers and satellite
domains connect to core domains. For backwards compatibility, 2.16
included the legacy UDP discovery service in `dCacheDomain` and
`dCacheDomain` was a core domain by default.  This UDP service is no
longer included and compatibility with pools older than 2.16 has been
dropped. `dCacheDomain` no longer defaults to being a core domain and
it is in fact no longer a special name - you may call it whatever you
like.

This however means that unless you define some domain as a core
domain, none of your dCache domains will be connected and you will be
left with an inoperative dCache. If you haven't already done so in
2.16, upon upgrade designate one of your domains as a core domain by
defining `dcache.broker.scheme = core` for it. Your former
`dCacheDomain` would be an obvious candidate for such a domain.

#### Lots of improvements to service life-cycle management

We made lots of changes to the life cycle of dCache cells. These
changes are mostly internal, but the short story is that we try to
improve how dCache starts and in particular how it can cleanly shut
down.

In the past, clean shutdown wasn't all that important as the service
would be inoperable anyway when shut down. With the addition of high
availability deployments, this assumption is no longer true and we
would like to be able to shut down cleanly. The goal has not been
achieved yet in dCache 3.0, as there are still plenty of issues
causing exceptions on shutdown, but the situation should be better than
in previous releases.

As an admin, the obvious change you will observe is that errors in the
log files have changed. In particular we log more stack traces when
detecting errors and we log cells that shut down slowly; even though
slow shutdown isn't necessarily an error as many services now do more
work while shutting down.


#### New wire protocol for cell communication

A new wire protocol for interdomain TCP connections for cell
communication has been introduced. This protocol has lower overhead
than the old protocol. Connections with 2.16 domains are detected
automatically and the old protocol is used as a fallback.

#### dcap: fewer threads and faster

The DCAP door was refactored. Compared to the earlier version it got:

- about half the number of threads than before,
- reuse of threads to reduce the overhead,
- detects client disconnects even if the door is busy,
- the legacy feature to block a DCAP door by defining the `dcapLock`
  entry in the domain context has been removed.


#### spacemanager: improved latency on non-spacemanager transfers

Space manager is sort of a proxy for pool manager. When enabled, doors
send requests they usually would send to pool manager to space manager
instead. This had the effect of adding a little extra latency to all
transfers, even reads and unmanaged transfers.

The interaction between pool manager, space manager and doors has been
heavily refactored. One consequence is that the space manager can
inject its own behaviour into the doors. This allows the requests to
be sent directly to pool manager if it can be determined that space
manager is not involved in processing it.


#### poolmanager: persist setup file in ZooKeeper

The pool manager setup is now preserved across restarts even without
saving the setup to disk. This is achieved by persisting the setup in
ZooKeeper whenever it changes. Upon restart, the setup is loaded back
from ZooKeeper.

The consequence is that `poolmanager.conf` is only loaded when either
no setup can be found in ZooKeeper, or when the admin explicitly uses
the `reload` command. Restarting pool manager will not reload
`poolmanager.conf`. As before, the `save` command is used to update
`poolmanager.conf` and the file is not updated automatically.

This feature forms the basis of synchronizing the setup between
multiple instances of the pool manager in a high availability
deployment of dCache: Whenever the setup changes in one pool manager,
the setup is stored in ZooKeeper and other instances discover the
change and apply the update locally.

#### poolmanager: persist pool read-only status in pool manager setup

When using the `psu set pool -rdonly` command to mark a pool as read
only, this restriction was not persisted in the pool manager
configuration file. Consequently, the read only status would be reset
by a pool manager restart.

The read only status is now stored in both `poolmanager.conf` and
in ZooKeeper and thus the read only status of a pool survives restarts.

Note that the read-only status in pool manager is a separate concept
from the `pool disable` state defined in pools.

#### poolmanager: make the service replicable

Pool manager is now a replicable service. This means one can create
multiple redundant instances of pool manager and the load will be
distributed over the available instances.  The pool manager
configuration is synchronized through ZooKeeper. For a given set of
pool managers, a particular file is always processed by the same
instance.

#### poolmanager: allow decentralized pool selection

Pool manager has traditionally been the central place in which all
pool selection (assigning transfers to pools) has been performed. Pool
manager allows great flexibility in how this selection is performed,
including cost based replication, load and space triggered fallbacks,
staging from tape or to export pools, etc.

To accurately enforce the different selection strategies and the
various cost limits, it was essential that pool manager had a
complete picture of the load of all pools. Cost updates from pools are
only distributed every 30 seconds, so to obtain the necessary accuracy,
pool manager would update its internal cost estimates whenever it
selected a pool and it would also intercept messages between doors and
pools indicating the beginning and end of a transfer.

This model falls apart if pool selection is distributed over several
components as any adjustments to the internal cost state would be
local to the component selecting the particular pool. Such distributed
pool selection could be found in a high availability deployment of
dCache in which multiple redundant pool managers each perform pool
selection for a shard of the files. Another, not currently
implemented, scenario is delegating pool selection to doors to reduce
the latency of pool selection.

dCache 3 reimplements how the various cost limits of pool manager are
enforced. Rather than assuming that a pool manager has perfect
knowledge, pool selection is performed under the assumption of
reasonably, but not perfectly, accurate data. Whenever the pool
manager selects a pool it also encodes the _assumptions_ under which
this pool was selected (e.g. load is below a certain threshold, pool
has enough free space, etc). This assumption is forwarded by the door
to the pool and checked by the pool before enqueuing a mover. If the
assumption fails, a cost update is prematurely submitted to pool
manager and the mover creation request is rejected. The door will
resubmit the pool selection request to pool manager, which now has
more accurate cost information.

This change is mostly invisible, although it may certainly affect the
dynamic behaviour of pool manager, replication and assignment of
transfers to pools.

By the way, the `cm info` command of pool manager has been removed as
there is nothing useful for it to report now. The commands `cm set
active`, `cm set update`, `cm set debug`, `cm set magic` are
obsolete. These should be removed from `poolmanager.conf` on upgrade.


#### poolmanager: improve stability of hot spot replication

Pool manager can be configured to trigger replication of files when
the source pool exceeds a certain load threshold.

Unfortunately, the load was defined in terms of the average relative
queue length of the various mover queues on the pool, including the
queues of pool to pool transfers. Since pool to pool queues typically
(and wisely) have low limits, the relative weight in the load
calculation of pool to pool transfers is often high. The consequence
is that triggering a replication may itself push the calculated load
of the pool higher, triggering even more replications. This is bound
to generate an unstable system.

dCache 3 changes how the load of a pool is calculated to exclude the
two pool to pool queues as well as the HSM stage queue from the pool
calculation.  Existing cost cut limits may have to be retuned as the
calculated performance cost has changed.

#### pool: drop the limit on pool to pool receive queues

A pool has two queues dedicated to pool to pool transfers; one for
sending files and one for receiving files. The receiving end does not
limit the number of concurrent transfers to avoid deadlocks in pool to
pool transfers. For purposes of calculating a performance cost, the
pool did however define a limit anyway (as the load was determined as
the average queue length _relative_ to the queue limit).

As described in the previous section, load no longer considers the
pool to pool queues and thus the unenforced limit on the receive queue
has been dropped. The pool `pp set max active` command has been
deprecated. The queued and max columns of the pool to pool receive
queue in `webadmin` and `httpd` are now empty.



#### pool: log why a mover is killed

The pool has been extended with support for injecting a message when
killing a mover. Components and services that kill movers make use of
this feature to document why the mover was killed. This information is
included in billing and depending on the protocol it may also be
propagated to the client.


#### pool: allow continuous flushing to tape

Traditionally, flush to tape on pools was batched by storage
class. Once a batch of files began to flush, new files arriving on the
pool would not begin flushing until the running batch would complete.
For HSM subsystems that do their own batching, the batching in dCache
is typically counterproductive as the driver or some external
component may wait for more files even though such files would be held
back by the pool to be included in the next batch.

To resolve this issue, dCache 3 adds an `-open` option to the `queue
define class` command in the `pool` service.  This option alters the
logic such that newly created files are added to an existing batch
immediately.

#### pool: support polling scripts with the HSM script driver

The classic `script` HSM driver invokes an external script to flush,
stage or remove files from tape. Usually, this operation is blocking,
meaning that many concurrent instances of this script will run at the
same time.

Some clever admins have found a workaround for this scalability issue
by letting the script poll for the completion of the operation. Rather
than block, the script terminates with a failure. This relies on
dCache pools retrying HSM operations. This works well, except that it
fills the billing files and log files with error messages.

To support this type of script, dCache 3 extends the `script` driver
to recognize 72 as a special return code. When the script exits with
this return code, the driver places the request back into its queue
and retries it without propagating the error to dCache. The result is
that the operation is retried without spamming the log files and
billing files. The retry period can be configured using the new
-p:delay option.

Note that for flush, the retry triggered by exit code 72 is within the
same batch. Thus new files will not be added to the queue until the
batch completes, except if the flush queue is defined with continuous
flushing (see the `-open` option in the previous section).


#### pool: alter failure semantics for empty files

When upload to a pool fails, the file is usually registered in the
name space like any other upload - if a checksum or file size was
predefined, the file may optionally be marked broken. In either case,
the file would be considered "complete" in the sense that no further
modifications to the file are allowed.

One common failure mode for uploads is when no data is uploaded at
all. This could be because the mover was killed before it could be
started, that is, while it is queuing; or because the client didn't
connect to the mover; or because the mover failed to connect to the
client. Networking issues could be a common source of such
failures. Due to the failure semantics, such movers could not be
retried by the door.

In dCache 3 the failure semantics for such empty uploads has changed
such that the replica on the pool is instead deleted and not
registered in the name space. The name space entry is left in its
"virgin state". Protocols like NFS and DCAP can open such files for
writing, allowing the upload to be retried.

Eventually, other doors will be updated to retry write mover creation,
but the current release doesn't do that yet.

#### pool: allow runtime management of mover queues

Pools allow movers to be placed on queues. Several queues may be
created, e.g. to treat internal and external transfers differently, or
to queue transfers by protocol.

Previously, custom queues were defined using the `pool.queues`
configuration property, requiring a pool restart to change the defined
queues.

In dCache 3, the admin shell commands `mover queue create` and `mover
queue delete` have been added instead. The existing `pool.queues`
property is deprecated. The queue definitions are persisted to the
pool setup file when issuing the `save` command.

By the way, the unused `mover remove` command has been removed.


#### pool: deprecated commands for HSM limits have been removed

The deprecated `rh set max active`, `st set max active` and `rm set
max active` are no longer support in pool setup files. Use the
equivalent provider specific options instead. Upon upgrade we
recommend running the pool `save` command before upgrading - at least
if this has not been done since upgrading to 2.9.


#### pool: optimize Berkeley DB meta data updates

The part of the pool abstracting file and meta data operations - the
repository - has been heavily refactored. One consequence is that
Berkeley DB updates are now transactional, improving consistency and
hopefully performance too as updates are batched together.


#### pool: allow CEPH to be used as a storage backend

One consequence of the heavily refactored repository component in
pools is that it has become easy to plug in alternative backends.
CEPH is a distributed block storage that has gained popularity in
recent years. In dCache 3, CEPH can be used as a backend for pools,
allowing the file data to be stored in CEPH. The meta data is kept in
the traditional Berkeley DB format.

See the documentation of the `pool.backend` property for choosing an
alternative backend. Several CEPH related properties starting with
`pool.backend.ceph` have been added. Consult the documentation in
`pool.properties` for details.

One consequence of the change is that HSM drivers can no longer expect
replicas to be stored as files on the local file system. Instead
replicas in a pool are now identified by a URI. When developing HSM
drivers or HSM scripts, this should be taken into
consideration. Backwards compatibility is however important to the
dCache team and as long as a local file system is used, the HSM driver
and HSM scripts are passed a regular path rather than a URI.

It has to be stressed that CEPH support is considered an experimental
feature. The more encouraging news is maybe that this shows that it is
fairly easy to hook alternate storage backends into dCache.


#### pool: sorted listing of movers

In the _nice to have_ category, dCache 3 supports options in the
`mover ls` admin shell command to sort the output by mover's last
access time and transferred data size.

#### ftp: port door to Netty

Netty is an non-blocking I/O framework used by xrootd doors and for
xrootd and http movers in pools. In dCache 3.0 ftp doors make use of
Netty too. This is pretty much transparent, but it allows the
door to scale to more concurrent connections with lower resource
usage.

By the way, we also upgraded to Netty 4.1 with buffer pooling enabled
- this should reduce Java garbage collection overhead.

#### ftp: abort upload if SRM invalidates TURL

Previously, when the transfer URL generated by the SRM was invalidated,
either because it expired, the request was aborted, or the SURL was
deleted, the underlying FTP upload would be allowed to continue. The
upload would eventually fail when the last byte had been transferred,
wasting bandwidth and generating a misleading error.


This has been changed such that the SRM will kill an FTP upload when
it invalidates a TURL.

#### srm: added extra fields to the srm access log

The srm access log contains a description of every client request. In
dCache 3, several extra fields have been added. In particular for
single file requests, the access log now contains the path of the file
to which the request applies.

#### webdav: use relative links in generated HTML

The default templates for the HTML view of the `webdav` door now use
relative links. This should make it easier to use the door behind a
reverse proxy or load balancer.

#### webdav: allow template to be reloaded at runtime

The `webdav` service generates the HTML view from admin configurable
template files. A `reload template` command was added to trigger the
template to be reloaded at runtime. The new
`webdav.enable.auto-reload.templates` configuration property may be
used to enable automatic reloading whenever the template changes.

#### xrootd: select mover queue by application name

The `xrootd` door can now select a pool mover queue by client application
name. See the documentation of the `xrootd.app-ioqueue` configuration
prefix in `xrootd.properties` for details.

It should be stressed that the application name is submitted by the
client and is easy to fake.

#### xrootd: recognize oss.asize parameter

Xrootd clients submit the file size upon upload as an `oss.asize`
property. dCache now recognizes this property and uses it in space
reservations, pool selection, and file verification. If the uploaded
file does not match the specified size, the file is marked as broken.

#### nfs: autodiscovery of nfs4domain for idmapping

For correct user id mapping nfs4 requires that server and client use
the same naming scope, called nfs4domain. This implies a consistent
configuration on both sides. To lower deployment overhead a special
auto-discovery mechanism was introduced by SUN Microsystems - a DNS
TXT record. Staring from version 3.0 dcache supports this discovery
mechanism. When `nfs.domain` property is set, it gets used. If it's
left unset, then DNS TXT record for `_nfsv4idmapdomain` is taken or
the default `localdomain` is used when DNS record is absent.

See [nfsmapid and DNS TXT Records](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-4555/epubp/index.html) for more information.

#### nfs: improved protocol compatibility and stability

Nfs door now can share a single mover between multiple transfers to a
file by the same user coming from the same host. This should improve
compatibility with existing clients as they expect such behavior which
is allowed by nfs protocol specification.

#### nfs: added support for flexfile file layout

Flexfile layout type aims to be an extension to pNFS to allow the use of
storage devices in a fashion such that they require only a quite limited
degree of interaction with the metadata server. The RHEL 7.2 and it's
derivatives are providing experimental support for flexfile layout
type. With this release, dcache starts to issue flexfile layouts if
requested by a client.

#### Add support for the HAProxy proxy protocol

The `ftp`, `xrootd`, `webdav`, `srm`, `httpd`, and `frontend` services
have been extended with support for the HAProxy proxy
protocol. HAProxy or similar load balancers are essential components
of a high availability deployment.

These load balancers act as frontends for redundant services in
dCache. One problem of using such a proxy is that the real IP address
of the client is hidden from dCache, thus obscuring dCache log files
and hindering network based pool selection.

The HAProxy proxy protocol is an adhoc standard supported by many load
balancers and proxy servers. It adds a small header to the connection
between the proxy and the backend service revealing the IP address of
the client to the backend. The new configuration properties
`.enable.proxy-protocol` enable support for this protocol. *Note*:
Once enabled, direct access from client to the respective door must be
blocked as clients would otherwise be able to conceal their real address
to the service.

Check the documentation in the relevant default `.properties` files
for information of which versions of the proxy protocol are supported.


#### New mechanism for determining services to monitor

The `httpd` service - both the old style and the newer `webadmin`
interfaces - monitor other services in dCache. The mechanism for
determining which services to monitor has changed. In the past the
list of services was configured in `httpd`; this has been replaced by
a multi-cast topic. Any service subscribing to this topic will be
monitored and shown in the web interface.


The name of the topic is defined by the property
`dcache.topic.watched`, although there shouldn't be a need to change
this (maybe if one wants to partition the services to be monitored by
multiple `httpd` instances, one could consider introducing multiple
topics, but why one may want to do this eludes me). The important part
is that this is the topic a service should subscribe to if it should
be monitored. By default, `gplazma`, `pnfsmanager`, `poolmanager`,
`spacemanager`, and `srmmanager` subscribe to this topic. Doors and
pools are discovered through other means and are monitored despite not
subscribing to the topic.




#### Production ready support for high availability deployments

As may have been obvious from several of the changes above, lots of
work went into enabling high availability (HA) deployments with
dCache. Some benefits of such a deployment are:

- No single point of failures
- Rolling updates
- Horizontal scaling
- Symmetric deployments

For most parts, there isn't much to configure for an HA deployment as
one can simply deploy several instances of the various services. There
are however several pitfalls, e.g. which databases should be shared
and which should not. Available documentation should be studied
carefully and any deployment should be tested before it is rolled out
on the production system.

Several external components are required for a true HA deployment to
load balance between doors (e.g. HAProxy) and handle HA for PostgreSQL
(repmgr).

Also, there are still a few components that do not handle redundant
deployments well, eg. resilience and replica manager. It may be argued
that redundancy of these components is not essential. 

Controlled draining of services is currently not automated and
requires some knowledge of the inner workings of dCache. Although
support for HA may be production ready, it should currently be
considered an expert feature.
