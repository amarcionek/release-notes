<h1>What's new in dCache 4.2<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

(tbd, this section uses markdown formatting)

This release ships with dCache-View 1.4+ which provides a new version of the
familiar admin pages.  Currently, access to these new pages requires the user
to be authorized (and to assert) the admin role.  The pages are only fully
populated with their respective data when, in addition to the frontend service,
the alarms and history services are running, and the billing service has
the database backend enabled.

With this release, dCache-View completely replaces the (Wicket-based) “webadmin”
interface, which is no longer available on ports 2288 and 8440.  (The
old static pages at http://<host>:2288/old are, on the other hand, still available,
but these, too, will eventually be removed in a future release.)

## Incompatibilities

Some changes 
([a11ec8d76b](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/a11ec8d76b549e3e1de948e2848d73d86725029e),
[887d8d5738](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/887d8d5738c6e2c554af8cd14e9ff8028b5e0573) and
[2ff49b600c](https://github.com/dCache/dcache/commit/2ff49b600c5f7e24148596a8a70f26af0bdd12ea)
) in the current release require that Pool Manager, Space Manager and Door 
instances must be updated to 4.2 at the same time. For users that wish to do incremental
updates, pools may remain at 4.1 during that update.

## Release 4.2.0

### Admin

The admin sshd server supoports public key and password authentication mechanisms. 
Some facilities have cyber security policies that explicitly disallow these mechanisms. 
This release adds the kerberos authentication mechanism to the admin sshd server and
introduces the ability to enable specific authentication mechanism(s) to conform to
different security policies. The following configuration variables 
have been added to control the behavior:

```
admin.ssh.authn.enabled = kerberos,password,publickey
```

(password and publickey are enabled by default). If kerberos 
authentication is chosen, there is a second configuration variable pointing at
the location of the keytab file on your system:

```
admin.ssh.authn.kerberos.keytab-file = /etc/krb5.keytab
```



### Alarms

### Billing

### Cleaner

### DCAP

### Frontend

The JSON returned from the RESTful admin services now sorts lists (especially
things like pool names) in natural ascending order for improved readability.
Swagger annotations for these services have been improved and regularized.
If the history service is not running, the absence of data is now handled
peacefully.  Finally, when a mover is killed via the frontend, but the
transfer has already completed, the cached entry is now correctly invalidated;
an intervening request for the mover listings from the frontend should display
any killed mover's state as "CANCELED" until it is in fact removed from the
cache during the ensuing refresh (to get this correct behavior, however,
the pools must also be updated to 4.1.9 or better).

As mentioned above, this release includes a version of dcache-view (1.4.2)
which implements the full set of admin pages.

### FTP

The GridFTP door (by default) tries to establish data connections
directly between the client site and the pool.  Ultimately, this is
under the clients control: the client can issue commands that force
dCache to proxy data connections.

The MODE-E extension allows data to flow over multiple TCP connections
and for those connections to be reused across multiple transfers.
This makes it harder to know the current status of a FTP session's
proxy.

To help alleviated this problem, the `info` admin command now shows an
ASCII-art rendition of the current data transfers.  The door's proxy
is represented by a box, showing the door's client-facing and
pool-facing IP address and port numbers.

The corresponding remote IP address and port numbers for the pool and
the client are also shown, along with the current status of the TCP
connections using the following scheme:

| Symbol        | Meaning
|:-------------:| -------------
| `========`    | Establish
| `--<--<--`    | Half-closed (data flowing to the left)
| `-->-->--`    | Half-closed (data flowing to the right)
| `........`    | Closed

Here is an example, showing the status half-way through transferring a
file with `globus-url-copy` using the options `-no-g2 -p 5`

### History

### Hoppingmanager

### httpd

### Info

### Missing Files

### NFS

For situations, where transfers stay in pending state in the nfs door two new admin command are added to
let door to 'forget' the transfer or retry it. Such situations can be result of network errors or when
cell communicatioin tunnels get restarted due to core domain restart.

```
 transfer retry
 transfer forget
```

Some deployments may have quite a busy export nfs file. To make it more managable starting release 4.2 dCache
supportd exports.d directory. The configuration property ```nfs.export.dir``` controls the location of the
directory. By default **/etc/exports.d** is used. Only files ending in .exports  are  considered.
Files beginning with a dot are ignored.

### Pinmanager

### PNFS Manager

The internal pnfsid <=> inumber cache can be configured to run in the cluster mode, e.g. multiple PnfsManagers
can share the same cache.  However, as this functionality is not required by current release cluster
configuration is not enabled.

### Pool

### Poolmanager

Added support for glob in **psu remove pool**:
```
psu remove pool dcache-pool-A*
```

### Resilience

Three issues of some importance have been addressed.

First, Resilience no longer will (incorrectly) report on non-resilient
files which have been corrupted.

Second, the computation of the number of copies needed when a storage
requirement changes was fixed so that it is now possible to go from N to M
and have resilience react correctly (by removing all but M; in particular,
the case where M = 1 was not being handled at all).

Finally, in connection with the latter, the default 'required' value on storage
units has been changed from 1 to undefined.  The only resulting behavioral change
is that resilience will now completely ignore files with the default storage
unit tag rather than alarming when no copies are readable.  '-required=1' is
different in that resilience will instead raise an alarm if the single copy
is not accessible.  This change creates a clearer distinction between
resilient and non-resilient files.

### Space Manager

### SRM

### SRM Manager

### Statistics

### Topo

### Transfer Managers

### WebDAV

### XRootD

Kafka messaging system can now be enabled for xrootD.
`xrootD.enable.kafka` controls whether the Kafka messaging system is used for message deliver.
`xrootD.enable.kafka = true|false` `xrootD.kafka.bootstrap-servers= host1:port,host2:port`

### Zookeeper
