<h1>What's new in dCache 2.16<br/>
<small>The release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

* New experimental RESTful API.

* New experimental end user web interface called dCacheView.

* New experimental support for redundant cell communication using
  multiple message brokers.

* New resilience service for managing file replicas. Will eventually
  replace the replica manager.

* New experimental support for replicable services.

* Scalable SRM frontend service.

* Limited OpenID Connect support.


## Incompatibilities

* Apache ZooKeeper is now a required dependency.

* Several database schemas will be updated upon upgrade. This includes
  billing and pinmanager. Upon downgrade, these schemas must be rolled
  back using the `dcache database rollbackToDate` command *prior* to
  downgrading dCache. Third party code that uses these database will
  possibly have to be modified.

* The dCache location manager can no longer be configured to establish
  arbitrary topologies.

* The `srm` service was split into two services - a frontend service
  called `srm` and a backend service called `srmmanager`. Both are
  required to operate an SRM service in dCache.

* Support for the SRM 1 protocol has been dropped.

* The FTP door's default root path behavior now matches that of
  other doors. That is, it no longer uses the per user root setting
  as the root directory. The original behavior can be restored
  by appropriate configuration.

* The `RemoteTransferManager` and `CopyManager` cells of the
  `transfermanagers` service have been merged.

* Sites with a custom `httpd.conf` configuration will have to adjust
  this upon upgrade to inject the cell address of the `info` service.

## Release 2.16.38

### webdav

A recent update, commit 5abc0e1c, improved the behaviour of the Milton WebDAV libraries if an IOException occurs
during an upload. That patch, unfortunately, did not address all issues, and when non-spec-conformant clients
are used against dCache, stacktraces can be triggered.

This patch corrects that behaviour. Also, in case of errors, the error code returned in case of any problems
was changed from 400 to 500, which should signal cliens that they are free to retry the transfer after a timeout.

## Release 2.16.37

### webdav

File transfers through WebDAV doors could potentially bypass any Restrictions
checks in PnfsManager. This patch ensures that Restrictions are always checked
and observed, and improves PnfsManager's logging to give information in case
a Restrictions check is not posssible.

:   [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

## Release 2.16.36

### pinmanager

Upgrades from dCache 2.13 could occasionally fail during the Liquibase update stage. 
The database table `pinsv3` can not be dropped if it is still referenced by foreign
keys of other tables. This modification adds a `cascadeConstraints=true` modifier to 
the dropTable command used during the conversion process. Thereby, updates are possible
without errors and PinManager starts without issues after an upgrade.

Invalidation of VFS caches has been improved, so that there is no stale information left for
dot files.

## Release 2.16.34

### nfs

Debugging of stuck transfers has been facilitated by adding the status of transfers to the output of the `show transfers` command.

### system-test

The system-test module, used for demonstration or testing purposes, comes with a built-in X.509 infrastructure. With this release, expired certificates are replaced by new ones.

## Release 2.16.33

### Changes affecting multiple services

The version of the PostgreSQL driver used by dCache internally was brought up to 9.4.1212. This fixes the issue described in [liquibase bug 2939](https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-2939).

### chimera

In order to improve IO performance, the way dCache updates `atime` values was modified.

### nfs

An internal change in the NFS door code helps reducing irrelevant exceptions being logged.

### srm

SRM no longer times out file requests. 
This alleviates a rare race condition where timeouts for the file request and file access competed. 
Requests that time out now always return SRM_REQUEST_TIMED_OUT at request
level and SRM_FAILURE for the SURLs in that request.

## Release 2.16.30

### chimera

The current release fixed database query for storing multiple checksums for a file.

### ftp

The Socket `read` method may return zero to indicate that no bytes were
read. Although this is not an error, such occurances will result
in a transfer failing.

This is now fixed.

## Release 2.16.28

### ftp

The current release improves compatibility between dCache FTP client and Globus GridFTP server.


### resilience

When a file has no readable replicas, the default behavior of resilience
is to raise an alarm. Files marked `CUSTODIAL` were excluded from this.
The current release fixed this in a way that an alarm is raised for all files without readable disk copies, whether the file is `CUSTODIAL`  or not.

### srm

During an ATLAS stress-test of tape recalls, it was discovered that
various sites had relatively short request lifetimes. However, the SRM
spec provides the opportunity for the server to inform the client (FTS,
in this case) of what lifetime a request actually has.
The current release includes the requests remaining lifetime in the response from the server.

The current release improves the documentation to help Admins to have a better understanding how to configure dCache correctly.

## Release 2.16.27

### frontend

This release of dCache ships with an updated dCache View version. 

### xrootd

In https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/issues/459, it became apparent that dCache could improve xrdcp compatibility by sending
checksum information in lower case. This release contains this change, which should improve xrootd operations.

The list of Delete Notification targets that the Cleaner will inform when a file's content has been cleaned is admin-configurable. 
In order to facilitate this configuration, the 'show info' command has been modified to also show Delete Notification targets.

### srm

The SRM code has been made more robust against races between file deletions and copies.

### systemtest

The 'system-test' script was updated to ensure anonymous dcap tests succeed.

## Release 2.16.25

### cells

Fixed a race condition and logging bug affecting cells relying on zookeeper. This
could affect location manager, space manager and pool manager.

### gplazma-ldap

Wrong quoting of two gplazma property strings could occasionally cause IllegalArgumentExceptions to be thrown when using LDAP-based logins. This problem has now been fixed.

### locationmanager

Fixed a problem in Location Manager in which it would fail to shut down
and could leave two overlapping connectors running.

## Release 2.16.23

### dcache

The current release updated dcache-view version.

### poolmanager

Ability to restrict staging to specific protocol was missing in
stage protection specification. Additionally it was not possible to
specify DN, FQAN, storage group and protocol that are not allowed
to stage.  

This is now fixed and stage protection configuration can be used as a blacklist.

The is fixed now and  client side sees no such file or directory error and no stack trace in log file.

### transfermanager

The output of `info`, `queue`, `ls internal` and `ls external` admin
commands in RemoteTransferManager has been improved.

## Release 2.16.21

### cleaner

Users reported that they wanted to see space freed up by cleaner processes
to be reported as free as soon as possible. This patch sends notifications
about freed up space more often, resulting in quicker status updates.

### pool

A problem was fixed that could cause the csm check to fail on pools 
containing broken files.

When deleting files, the cleaner submits batches of files to delete to a pool,
but this batch is then processed sequentially. In order to improve deletion
performance, such deletion tasks are now run concurrently. The
increase in concurrency can reduce the overhead of syncing the meta data to
disk after every deletion, thus increasing the deletion rate.

## Release 2.16.19

### dcap

Connections of non-DCAP clients to a dCache no longer result in stack-traces in the logs.

### pool

A lock contention scenario in the migration module was removed, increasing performance and throughput.

### poolmanager

PoolManager was updated to properly handle the `dcache.authz.staging.pep` and `dcache.authz.staging` parameters. This allows to enable stage protection properly.

### resilience

When building the central pool information data structure for resilience
(PoolInfoMap), it was (erroneously) assumed that pool group names would 
never conflict with storage unit names, since the latter would always contain an '@'.

Obviously, there is no restriction on the naming of pool groups, so
it is possible (though perhaps unlikely) that the name of a group
could be identical to that of a storage unit.   In this case,
when the PoolInfoMap is updated, the storage group will overwrite
the values for the pool group.  This will eventually lead to the
failure of all files belonging to that pool group to be replicated.

This potential problem was mitigated by this patch.

Resilience Manager was updated to support globbed expressions for PoolSelectionUnits.

A Python script, `share/migration/migrate_from_repman_to_resilience.py`, is provided for migrating from replica manager to the new resilience service. 

### srmclient

SrmShell has been modified to actively probe for connection information that the
user has not specified. This reduces unnecessary reconnection attempts.

If an SRM request originating from a BeStMan system has to be rejected, the client now properly
reports the situation.

## Release 2.16.18

### Changes affecting multiple services

Fixed a bug in admin and in the pool manager rebalancer component that
caused these to not detect certain error replies from other components.

Internal notification processing between cleaners and Pin Manager, Replica Manager and Space Manager was improved and runs quicker now.

### admin

Fixed a problem in which connecting the admin shell to a named queue
caused messages to be sent to one of several consumers rather than the
one cell than the admin prompt would indicate as the connected cell.

### billing

If a dCache instance was shut down while the billing service was in the middle of a refresh,
an exception was logged and shutdown was delayed. A change in exception handling fixes this rare
scenario, ensuring a quick shutdown and no unnecessary log entries.

### cells

In some cases, problems with two connectors running to the same
core domain have been observed. This release improves message handling in connectors and improves debugging for problem cases.

Fixed a null pointer exception in location manager caused by loss of connection
to zookeeper.

### common

The representation parameter lists in help texts was improved.

Text output has been improved so that no trailing whitespace characters cause layout problems any more.

### dcap

This release makes it possible for admins to ban outdated, problematic versions of dcap clients. 
Some old client versions contain a bug that causes the
client to make unsatisfiable requests to a pool with no way for dCache
to reject the request: the client will simply retry. 

The client version limits are exposed using the new configuration property `dcap.limits.client-version`.
The default is to allow all dcap client versions, unchanged from the previous behaviour. 

This release fixes a regression through which Kerberos dcap would not work for host principals containing a '-' character. GSI dcap was not affected.

### doors

Fixed a bug in the lb set tags command in doors that prevented setting
an empty list of tags.

### pool

A bug that caused non-critical stack traces to be logged on the pool after
stage or deletion failure from nearline storage has been fixed.

### srm

SRM logging has been improved: When SRM request tokens appeared in the access log, a regression, fixed by this release, caused them to be listed without a backend ID prefix even if they carried one.

### srmclient

The shell's built-in help support now includes some additional
information about available commands.

The SRM client now allows glob patterns for the  "check permission",
"get permission", "lrm", "lrmdir", "rm" and "rmdir" commands.

Until now, SrmFS could not connect to StoRM instances. This release updates the `cd` command so that a connection to StoRM is now possible.

The srmmanager and statistic services included hard-coded cell name
for the billing service.  This release updates these services to
honour the configured name for billing.

### billing

Fixed a problem in the output of the `dcache billing` command using
JSON or YAML when the billing format includes a custom date format.

### dcap

Add support for the dcap client supplying additional version
information.

### frontend

Upgrade dCache-view to v1.0.2, which brings several improvements.

### gplazma

Fix `explain login` and `test login` commands so they are able to test
logging in with username and password.

Add examples to `explain login` command help.  Our thanks to Onno
Zweers for this change.

### httpd

Fix regression in the `transfers.txt` output format.

Update the transfers.html page so it no longer includes `<unknown>`
for default/unknown protocols.  With this version of dCache, these are
represented by a `?` character.  The webadmin page is updated to give
consistent output.

### scripts

Fix the billing indexer to ignore the `format` string, if present.

## Release 2.16.15

### commons

If dCache's internal ShellApplication framework detects a critical behaviour
that might indicate a bug in the application, error messages now include
an explicit request to send a mail to the developers and more relevant
information for assessing and reproducing the situation.

### gplazma2

This release fixes a small bug in GPlazma which inappropriately 
tried to handle non-DN subjects in x509 certificates.
These will usually fail in gPlazma anyway, but the reported error 
was confusing.

### srm

Handling of DNS names without trailing dots in certificates has been made more robust and universal.

### srmclient

SRM client gained limited UNIX-like commands for navigating file systems.
From this release on, it offers the `lpwd`, `lcd`, `lls`, `lrm`, `lrmdir`, 
`lmkdir` and `lmv` commands, which work similar to the corresponding 
UNIX commands that do not use the 'l'-prefix.

The `get`and `put` commands have been updated and do now resolve 
local paths relative to the local current working directory.

A new `prompt` command allows users to modify their prompt.

This means that users are now able to modify their local directory when preparing for
upload/download to an SRM endpoint.  The local directories for uploads
and downloads may also be modified.

The handling of empty directories in SRM's `ls` has been improved.

srmfs checks whether a user can change into a given SURL, but did 
previously not handle cases gracefully where the server declined
such a request. This behaviour has been improved.

Error messages for SRM client are now more informative.

## Release 2.16.14

### cells

The current release fixes a race condition through which routes to non-existing cells could be set up.

A race condition could lead to default routes pointing to tunnels that no longer exist. This has been fixed.

In rare cases, an interrupt needed to cleanly shut down the location manager connector would not arrive. This issue was corrected, ensuring more reliable behaviour on cell shutdown.

Fixed a problem with phantom tunnel connectors causing tunnel connections between
satellite and core domains to be reestablished about every 10 seconds.

A regression in which cell startup failures were not propagated to
the starting component was fixed. As with the related fixes, this
provides more robust cell lifecycle changes.

Fixed a problem in which threads could inappropriately be created as daemon threads,
causing problems in killing those threads when the cell shuts down.

Fixed a race that could lead to corrupted state in the routing manager.

### srmclient

Previously, sending SIGKILL to srmclient did not properly terminate the process. This was mainly caused by bash not propagating SIGKILL to child processes. This has been worked around, and SIGKILL now works as expected against srmclient.

When used against a server that responds asynchronuously, the stat command would never terminate. This behaviour was changed by introducing a short delay between successive retries, making stat more robust.

Currently dCache distinguishes between SURLs that have a port number and
those that do not; therefore `srmrm srm://srm.example.org/file-1` will not
abort an upload issued with `srmcp file:///path/to/local-file
srm://srm.example.org/file-1`.

This has been changed, so that srmclient can now be used to upload files to a port-less SURL.

Error messages for srmclient were improved by adding more detailed information about `stat` and `ls` failures.

The -debug option of srmclient now provides much more useful output.

### webdav

Currently, the WebDAV door returns a 401 status on permission problems even when the
user is authenticated.  This results in clients prompting users to
reauthenticate whenever the client makes a request that is denied for
authorisation reasons. Since this is not in line with the generally accepted
meaning of the status codes (401 standing for "please try again, but with Authorization header" and 403 for "please don't try again, admin intervention needed"), the behaviour of the door was changed. 

Note: If any installation used the fact that dCache returned the wrong
status-code as a "hackish" mechanism to clear the browser's BASIC credential cache
(e.g., to "log out"), this is no longer possible.

## Release 2.16.13

### commons

The \s admin command uses the toString method to serialise the requested
so that the remote cell may correctly parse it. This did not always
work: '=' characters in arguments were escaped but not unescaped;
arguments that start with a '-' character were not escaped; empty words
were lost. In the current release this is fixed and \s command works  as  expected.

### dcache

The current release fixes  a regression in which the exit code of check-config would
always be zero even when errors were detected.

### doors

The current release fixes  a bug that cost pool manager to adjust cost estimates on the wrong
mover queue when selecting pools.

### srmclient

The current release adds support in srmfs for uploading and downloading files.

## Release 2.16.12

### alarms

Alarm email notifications are now sent only on the first occurrence
of given alarm (i.e., for that alarm instance's unique ID).

If an alarm has been closed and not deleted,
but then occurs again, the counter for receiving that alarm
is now reset to 1, in order to treat this as a new (set of)
occurrences, and to guarantee a new notification will be sent.

### cells

Several bugs related to cell shutdown were fixed in this release. 
Most noticeably, tunnel connections could appear to fail, which has been corrected.

### webadmin

Due to an implementation detail in a library used for the webadmin pages, filtering 
tables was a bit unintuitive until now: A filter that was set in a certain table column would
reappear on tables in other browser windows if they had similar columns. 

This behaviour was corrected, and tables on different pages exposed simultaneously in different
browser tabs are now filtered independently. However, the fix also has the side effect that
now with page reloads and form submissions the filters are cleared. Any commands, however, will 
always be issued correctly.

Filtering rows in webadmin tables could occasionally lead to unintuitive behaviour with regard to selections:
Filtering a table and hiding rows may be included in a "select all" or "deselect all" operation.
This was fixed, and selection/Deselection of hidden rows is now prevented.

Issues with filter boxes disappearing or filters resetting have been solved by disabling
AJAX auto refresh for the affected pages.

## Release 2.16.11

### chimera

Chimera occasionally suffered from (operationally irrelevant) IllegalStateExceptions. Those are now avoided.

### doors

Doors could get stuck temporarily if a file was deleted during pool selection. This has been fixed, and in such cases, transfers are now aborted properly.

## Release 2.16.10

### billing

Formatting strings for the billing system have been extended to allow the names of the cell and cell domain to be addressed directly. Those names are accessible using `$cellName.cell$`and `$cellName.domain$`, respectively. This allows greater flexibility when creating informative messages. No existing formatting strings are affected by this change.

When using the `dcache billing` command with a non-default date format in the billing file, an unneccessary stack trace was printed. This has been corrected.

### cells

The handling of failures during cell startup was improved.

Fixed a RejectedExecutionException that could occur during shutdown.

### srm

The SRM should periodically (by default every 10 minutes) delete obsolete historic data (older than 10 days by default) from the database. For cases where there are problems with that process, error logging and robustness against temporary database problems have been improved.

### webadmin

The Wicket library used by dCache internally issued warnings about upcoming naming changes. Those cluttered the log files, and are silenced from the current version on.

### zookeeper

A race condition caused Zookeeper to report non-critical CancelledKeyException instances on shutdown. This has been fixed, streamlining the shutdown and reducing operationally irrelevant log entries.

Previously, when shutting down dCache, the zookeeper cell was sufficiently slow that
it required the System cell to explicitly interrupt still running threads. The shutdown has been accelerated, resulting also in less operationally irrelevant stack traces and errors reported in the process.

## Release 2.16.9

### Changes affecting multiple services


The current release fixes compatibility with OpenSSH 7.2.

### dcache-restful-api

The current release adds a restfull call to change  the QoS of a file  from `disk+tape` to `tape`.

### ftp

The Apache Commons FtpClient can issue the LIST command with the
non-standard `-a` option. Which was  causing dCache to switch
output format from the long (`ls -l`-like) to the short (`ls`-like)
response. This is fixed now and dCache is more compatible with Apache Commons FtpClient.

## Release 2.16.8

### billing

Deployments may use more than one billing service. In such a deployment one may want all instances to log the same billing messages. This may be achieved by treating 'billing' as a topic rather than a named queue. 

The `billing.cell.subscribe` property was added, allowing the billing service to subscribe to PubSub topics.

### cells

If the `create` command in CellShell fails because of unreadable setup files, it throws an IOException. This was incorrectly reported as a bug. Reporting has been corrected now.

In rare cases, active transfers would show up with an incorrect state in the active transfers page of the admin backend. This was fixed, so that ransfers which are staging from non-DCAP doors are correctly indicated (in yellow) on the active transfers page, instead of showing up as "No Mover found" (in red).

### common

If there is an IOException when trying to read a setup file, the corresponding file name is now listed in the error message.

### dcache-nearline-spi

Since AbstractBlockingNearlineStorage is a useful baseclass for third party nearline storage implementations, it was made available as part of the dcache-nearline-spi artifact.

### poolmanager

An issue with PoolManager prevented it from delivering correct cost estimates. This was fixed, resulting in improved estimations of pool load.

### srm

The error messages for aborted srmRM uploads were improved. Instead of just stating "Upload aborted because the file was deleted by another request", the message now includes the session ID of the remove request. This ID can be used by admins to find the remove request in the SRM access log.

### srmclient

Mac OS-X BSD has an implementation of readlink that doesn't support the -f option. A recent upgrade to SRM Client used that option, so a workaround was necessary. This release fixes the issue, and SRM Client works again on MacOS.

### transfermanager

Due to a regression, 3rd-party WebDAV transfers would show a NullPointerException in transfer manager, although they completed correctly. This problem was fixed, and the progress report information is correct again.

## Release 2.16.5

### alarms

A change to the alarms system improves handling of alarms with unset types.

### frontend 

Users can query existing Quality of Services, for example, storage requirements such as flexible allocation of disk or tape storage space. Possibility to  query QoS for the specified file object.

### httpd


An improvement to error checking avoids an unnecessary NullPointerException being logged.

### nfs

A race condition in the NFS door that could result in the creation of
multiple inconsistent copies of a file being uploaded has been fixed.

### pool

A regression was fixed that caused the `jtm go` command to occasionally not work.

When a transfer's status is queried before the transfer is initiated,
which can occasionally happen for queued requests, Exceptions were logged. 
This behaviour has now been corrected, providing more robust operation.

Permanent migration jobs were persisted in the pool setup file. The current release fixes  a problem causing permanent migration jobs to be duplicated
if the pool setup file was reloaded.

Several race conditions in the pool's migration module are fixed now.

A regression prevented queues to be set to not handle any jobs at all. The fix allows to pass a limit of 0 to `mover set max active`.

A regression was fixed that caused pools to "leak" movers if those were cancelled
while still being queued.

### resilience

Until now, a check was in place that made it impossible to link resilient storage units to non-resilient pool groups. This constraint has now been removed in order to accommodate use cases 
such as writing to a "staging" pool and then transferring from there to a resilient pool.

A potential race condition in Resilience Manager has been fixed.

File operations run concurrently, but are serialized with respect to
pnfsid. For any logical file, only one copy or remove is thus allowed
to run at a given time. In situations with several concurrent scans,
this update improves the handling of metadata on the affected files.

Removing pools from a resilient group is now handled in a more robust manner.

File operations run concurrently, but are serialized with respect to
pnfsid. For any logical file, only one copy or remove is thus allowed
to run at a given time. In situations with several concurrent scans,
this update improves the handling of metadata on the affected files.

A minor bug in target selection for a corner case has been resolved.

Resilience Manager now implements improved checks when determining whether or not a pool needs scanning after a state change.

Pools which were once resilient, but for which resilience has been deactivated,
no longer stick around in the operation map and thus disappear from the "pool ls" listing.

After the initial commit of Resilience, some classes were renamed to use "File"
rather than "Pnfs" as a more proper designation. With this release, all such occurences have been renamed.

### spacemanager

Fixes a compatibility problem with NFS in which space manager would fail with
a duplicate key error.

### srm

A hint to describe the necessity to include escaping has been added.

The current release adds small fixes to SRM shell.

The current release adds small fixes to SRM shell.

The current release fixes issues in which the use of SRM third party copy operations could cause
the SRM cell to become unresponsive, possibly even run out of memory.

## Release 2.16.4

### Changes affecting multiple services

Fix security vulnerability.  Affects following services: dcap, ftp,
srm, transfermanagers, webdav and xrootd.

## Release 2.16.3

### admin

The admin door now generates SSH keys to ensure compatibility with OpenSSH 7. Additionally,
a new property `admin.paths.host-keys` was introduced in the admin.properties file, 
allowing to specify the location of keys.

### build

A `code coverage` profile was added to the build system to check the coverage of our unit tests.
The coverage analysis uses JaCoCo as the technical foundation.

### cells

This release improves local message delivery.

A bug was fixed that caused delivery of messages to cells to fail
if the cell name was different from the cell service name.

### frontend

The login behaviour of the WebDAV frontend was changed. Now, if a user presents 
invalid credentials, the login attempt will fail and result in a 401 status code.
Previously, that case was treated as if the user had not presented any credentials
at all.

Normally, users get prompted for authentication when interacting with the WebDAV interface.
This is not desirable for AJAX requests coming from the web frontend. With this release,
Javascript can submit AJAX requests with username 'anonymous' to
achieve desired anonymous interaction without the browser prompting the
user for credentials if it turns out authentication is required.

### pool

A minor documentation error for the `rep ls` command was fixed.

### resilience

The behaviour of resilience manager was improved to allow easier operation in cases 
where a pool needs to be intentionally taken offline. Previously, a bug prevented
resilience from fully taking into account pools which were deliberately 'excluded' 
by the administrator. The redundant `pool suppress resilience` 
command on the pools has been removed; `pool exclude $POOLNAME` is the replacement.
Excluded pools are now correctly handled by resilience manager, and any marking of 
pools as excluded will survive a restart of the resilience manager.

### script

When a pool's metadata conversion operations would fail, an error caused
a script to report successful conversions. This error has been fixed now.

### webdav

There are WebDAV clients that do not send a `User-Agent` header along with 
their requests. dCache's WebDAV code has been updated to avoid 
NullPointerExceptions occuring in those cases.

### zookeeper

There was a race condition when creating log directories on a system using
a local Zookeeper service. In rare cases, this led to messages stating
	(System) [] URL [file:/usr/share/dcache/services/zookeeper.batch]: line 42: Command failed ((3) Unable to create data directory /var/lib/dcache/zookeeper/version-2; caused by: Unable to create data directory /var/lib/dcache/zookeeper/version-2)
and dCache not starting successfully. 
This race condition has now been fixed, and the log file creation is thus reliable now.

## Release 2.16.2

### admin

First observed on Ubuntu Xenial, dCache fails to install on modern 
Linux distributions due to the short key length of the SSH 1 keys 
generated in the post install script. This patch removes those keys
and their generation code. dCache has been supporting only modern 
key formats for quite some time now, so this change should not have
any impact on users.

### frontend

Removed unnecessary login prompts from dCacheView.

Previously, the REST interface did not provide a reliable way to
check whether credentials supplied by a user also led to that 
user being authenticated. With this change, clients can discover 
information such as whether or not a username+password combination 
is valid and which uid and gid(s) the user has.

In order to improve operation of dCacheView, corrected error codes are
introduced for situations where users try to query resources they 
are not allowed to.

### pool

This change provides more detailed internal error reporting on P2P 
transfer failures, supporting the new resilience manager in its decisions.

This patch corrects the pools' reporting behaviour when trying to access
a broken replica. In that case, pools would previously report that the
replica is locked which usually indicates that retrying will eventually allow
the request to succeed. This change supports the operation of the new 
resilience manager.

When creating movers, some error conditions are expected to 
occur and dCache is designed to transparently recover from 
these. Consequently, this patch lowers the log level for the
related error messages to reflect that their causes are 
harmless.

Fixed a staging problem that would lead to failures in 
nearline COPY operations.

Improved efficiency for pools under high resilience load.

The `queue activate` command was accidentally renamed `queue setIncluded`. This patch corrects the command name.

### resilience

When a p2p copy fails because it is trying to access a source
file before the pool repository has completed processing it,
the client receives a "Source pool failure (File is incomplete)"
error. Previously, the resilience manager would incorrectly 
consider this situation as an error requiring a retry from a
different data source. This patch corrects that mistake.

This change improves the efficiency of resilience manager by avoiding repeated
attempts to read from a location in case it is the only one available.

Improved exception handling in the resilience manager.

### srm

Some race conditions during SRM startup were fixed. Those race conditions
could potentially have lead to failures to expire jobs and to wrong job 
counts in the SRM schedulers.

### webdav

Until now, trying to access a file for which the client was not authorized
would generate a reply with a status code 200 OK, but an empty body, rather
than an error page. This patch corrects that behaviour and also improves
exception handling for that case.

## Release 2.16.1

### billing

Fixes a regression that made using the billing system with an HSQLDB
backend impossible. Since that backend can only be used for testing
purposes, the impact of this regression was low.

The data used to create the 24 hour billing overviews is aggregated
in hourly intervals before creating the plots. However, if there is
very high activity on the system during an entire 24 hour period,
there have occasionally been timeouts when querying the database for
this aggregate data. This patch makes the data aggregation more robust
against such situations, resulting in lower latency for histogram
generation and no more timeouts.

### gplazma

Previously, attempts to authenticate users against an htpasswd entry
that was malformed resulted in a stack trace. This patch modifies
the error handling so that only a detailed error message
("Bad entry in file: hash does not start '$1$' or '$apr1$") is logged.

## Release 2.16.0

#### Introduced Apache ZooKeeper as an external coordination service

Apache ZooKeeper is a naming, coordination, and synchronization
services. Starting with the release of dCache 2.16, Apache ZooKeeper
is a required dependency to run dCache. It is used by several
components in dCache -- e.g. for locating dCache domains, locating
services, and leader election. Future versions are most likely
increasing reliance on Apache ZooKeeper.

To make migration of existing deployments easy, we support using an
embedded ZooKeeper, i.e. the ZooKeeper server runs inside a regular
dCache service in a dCache domain. It is configured through
dCache's own configuration system. For easy upgrade, add the following
as the *first* domain in the layout file of the host with
`dCacheDomain`:

    [zookeeperDomain]
    [zookeeperDomain/zookeeper]

By placing this domain on the host running `dCacheDomain`, other
domains in dCache will be able to locate the ZooKeeper instance without
configuration changes. Eventually you should configure
`dcache.zookeeper.connection` rather than `dcache.broker.host` to
allow dCache domains to locate ZooKeeper.

If using the embedded ZooKeeper service, we recommend running
`zookeeper` in its own dCache domain to avoid runtime dependencies
between the ZooKeeper server and the client inside dCache connecting
to it. In particular the low level cells system itself relies on
ZooKeeper, presenting problems during startup and shutdown of the
domain hosting `zookeeper`. Such problems are minimized by running the
service in its own domain, but error messages in the log files during
startup and shutdown are inevitable.

For improved stability, we recommend installing a stand-alone ZooKeeper
independently from dCache. Many Linux distributions have packaged
ZooKeeper already.

ZooKeeper can be deployment in a redundant setup, typically on three
or five servers, allowing respectively one or two instances to fail
without loosing the service.

We have placed further information on using ZooKeeper with dCache at
https://github.com/dCache/dcache/wiki/ZooKeeper.

#### Add user information to billing database

If using the billing database backend, the `billinginfo` and
`doorinfo` tables are extended with additional columns to represent
information about the user performing the transfer. This includes the
owner string, the primary FQAN, the UID and primary GID.

Upon downgrading to an earlier release, the schema must be rolled back
using the `dcache database rollbackToDate` command. Doing so will
erase the data stored in the new columns.

#### Storage class was added when listing movers

The output of the `mover ls`, `st ls` and `rh ls` commands have been
extended to show the storage class of the file being transferred,
flushed, or restored.
    

#### Obsoleted `dcache.authn.gsi.crl.cache.lifetime`

dCache no longer uses JGlobus and thus this property is no longer used.



#### New `resilience` service

The `resilience` service replaces the `replica` service. The `replica`
service is still included in dCache 2.16, but we encourage sites that
rely on it to migrate to the `resilience` service. The `replica`
service will eventually be removed from dCache.

In contrast to the `replica` service, `resilience` offers many
benefits, such as not relying on its own database and thus not
suffering from state synchronization issues, more flexible
configuration in terms of which files are to be replicated, not
relying on dedicated pools, more robust operation, works with any
retention policy, detecting and recovering broken replicas, allowing
temporary suppression of replication on particular pools, integration
with the `alarm` service, and more.

Separate documentation for the `resilience` service will be posted.

#### Overhaul of cell routing topology

dCache cell communication used to have a complex configuration system
allowing arbitrary topologies of dCache domains to be formed. A hidden
service called the location manager was embedded in all dCache domains
and coordinated how connections between domains were
established. Inside dCacheDomain the location manager deployed a
simple UDP service that other domains used to discover how they should
interconnect. To our knowledge all sites used the default star
topology in which the dCacheDomain was the central messaging hub for
all other domains.


In dCache 2.16 this has been completely reimplemented. The UDP based
configuration discovery system previously used by location manager has
been replaced by Apache ZooKeeper. The UDP based service is still
supported in a legacy mode to allow rolling upgrades from earlier
versions. dCache 2.17 will not support the legacy mode.

The location manager service no longer supports arbitrary
communication topologies to be formed. Domains are configured
individually to be either core domains or satellite domains, with the
former being messaging hubs. The default is for dCacheDomain to be the
only core domain. This maintains the previous default behavior.

The major new feature is the ability to have multiple core domains,
i.e. multiple message hubs, with all other domains connecting to all
core domains. This enables a redundant communication topology in which
a core domain can fail and the remaining services can maintain
connectivity through the remaining core domains.

We have published documentation about the dCache message passing
system at https://github.com/dCache/dcache/wiki/Message-passing. This
also includes information on redundant topologies.

The `System` cell embedded into every dCache domain provides the new
`traceroute` command which allows the route between two cells to be
discovered.


#### dCache Service Names


Traditionally central services in dCache have had well-known names like
`PnfsManager` and `PoolManager`. Other services -- and the operator
through the `admin` service -- could communicate with those services
using the short well-known name rather than the longer fully qualified
cell address.

Starting with dCache 2.16 such services have a configurable service
name instead. The service name typically coincides with the cell name,
but they are no longer linked.

E.g. the `pnfsmanager` service defaults to a cell name `PnfsManager`
(defined by the `pnfsmanager.cell.name` property), which when
instantiated in a domain called `namespaceDomain` may be addressed as
`PnfsManager@namespaceDomain`. The `pnfsmanager` service now also has
the new `pnfsmanager.cell.service` property, which happens to default
to `PnfsManager` too, allowing the cell to be addressed with the
shorter `PnfsManager` name, just like before.

The difference is that these are no longer coupled. The cell name and
the service name may be changed independently. This change applies to
all central services in dCache, i.e. most services except pools and
doors.

The `cell.export` properties are all marked deprecated. Affected
services have the new `cell.service` property.

More information about service names may be found at
https://github.com/dCache/dcache/wiki/Message-passing.

#### Replicable services

Under the hood, the changes related to the new service names described
above is much bigger than what may be apparent from the simple
description. Several services may now be replicated. In such a setup,
each instance of the service shares the same service name. This was
the motivation for separating cell names from service names.

In dCache 2.16 not all services are replicable. Those that are define
a `cell.replicable` property set to `true`,
e.g. `pnfsmanager.cell.replicable`. The `dcache services` command
shows whether services are replicable or not.

This feature is considered experimental. Documentation will be
published at
https://github.com/dCache/dcache/wiki/Replicable-services.

#### Split of SRM into a frontend and a backend

The SRM service has been split into a frontend service called `srm`
and a backend service called `srmmanager`. The frontend listens to the
SRM TCP port and is the endpoint clients communicate with. The backend
does all the request processing, including scheduling and persistence
in the SRM database.

This change allows multiple frontends to be deployed in a load
balanced setup while using a single `srmmanager` backend. Furthermore
the `srmmanager` backend may be replicated for improved fault
tolerance, scalability and rolling upgrades, but this is currently
considered experimental.

Upon upgrading, the simplest course of action is to add an
`srmmanager` service in the same domain as the existing `srm`
service. It is recommended to place `srmmanager` in from of the `srm`
service to ensure the backend starts before the frontend.

Note that many configuration properties previously defined for the
`srm` service now need to be defined for `srmmanager` instead. Such
properties have been renamed accordingly. Use `dcache check-config` to
validate your configuration prior to starting dCache.

Also note that if the export point of the namespace is changed using
`srmmanager.root` (formerly `srm.root`), then a similar change must be
applied to `srm.loginbroker.root`. Both default to the new
`dcache.root` property, so in most deployments it may be easier to
change the export point for doors by setting that property instead.

Upon upgrading, it is important that the scheduler ID of the
`srmmanager` matches the original cell name of the `srm` service. This
is because entries in the database are tagged with this ID and using a
different value means that old SRM requests are not cleaned upon
restart. The default scheduler ID matches the old default cell name of
the `srm` service and thus if deploying `srm` and `srmmanager` on the
same host and if the original service did no use a custom cell name,
no additional configuration changes are needed on upgrade.

More documentation will be published at
https://github.com/dCache/dcache/wiki/Replicable-services.



#### Chimera auto-discovers the correct database driver

Chimera used to have the `chimera.db.dialect` property to select the
database driver. The correct driver is now selected automatically and
`chimera.db.dialect` and similar service specific properties are now
deprecated.


#### New `frontend` service

The new `frontend` service offers a RESTful webapi and a modern user
facing web interface. The service is currently fairly limited, but we
expect it to be aggressively extended over the next feature
releases. It currently offers a RESTful API to navigate the name
space, and a browser interface to navigate this name space. The
regular `webdav` service is used as a backend for file transfers.

More documentation on this service will be published soon.

#### New property to define name space export point

Many doors now respect the new `dcache.root` property to define the
directory in the name space that is exposed to users. If defaults to
the chimera root directory. Note that this also applies to FTP
doors. Thus by default, FTP doors no longer use the per account root
directory defined in gPlazma. To restore the old behavior, set
`ftp.root` to the empty value.


#### gPlazma LDAP plugin now supports authenticating LDAP servers

The `gplazma` LDAP plugin can now authenticate with the LDAP server
using the new `gplazma.ldap.auth`, `gplazma.ldap.binddn`, and
`gplazma.ldap.bindpw` configuration properties.

#### Add user information to active transfer pages of `httpd`

The various active transfer pages now show the UID, primary GID and
primary FQAN of the user doing a transfer.

#### JSON output for active transfers page

The classic `httpd` web pages provides JSON output for ongoing
transfers. This complements the classic txt output. The information can
be accessed with something like `curl -s
http://localhost:2288/context/transfers.json`.

#### Pin manager database backend was rewritten

The `pinmanager` database backend was rewritten to no longer use the
DataNucleus ORM. Minor schema changes are applied during upgrade. Upon
downgrade these schema changes must be rolled back using the `dcache
database rollbackToDate` command.


#### The use of `Infinity` as a pool size is deprecated

Pools could be configured with `Infinity` as a size to indicate that
the size should be derived automatically from available disk
space. This value is now deprecated and the `pool.size` should be left
empty instead for automatically sized pools.



#### Improved `poolmanager` configuration reload

Several race conditions have been fixed in the `reload` command of the
`poolmanager` service. The command now also preserves the already
cached pool state, thus reducing the side effects of reloading the
`poolmanager` configuration.

#### Improved publishing of pool state

The `poolmanager` service provides information about pools to several
other services. This has been refactored to use publish-subscribe
messaging rather than have each service pool `poolmanager` for
updates. This change also allows `poolmanager` to publish updates on
pool status changes immediately, i.e. pools going offline or coming
back online are immediately propagated to e.g. `spacemanager` and
`resilience`.

#### `/var/lib/dcache` is owned by the `dcache` user

When using the Debian package, `/var/lib/dcache` was owned by user
`dcache` all along. This is now also the case for the RPM package.


#### SRM 1 support has been dropped

The dCache `srm` service no longer supports version 1 of the SRM protocol.

#### The internal cells of the `transfermanagers` service have been merged

The `RemoteTransferManager` and `CopyManager` cells have been
merged. Several properties related to the `CopyManager` cell have been
marked obsolete. Some of the runtime configuration commands of these
cells have been dropped.



#### Added caching of gPlazma mappings in `webdav` service

The WebDAV service now caches gPlazma mappings. See
`webdav.service.gplazma.cache.size` and
`webdav.service.gplazma.cache.timeout` for the new configuration
properties.

#### Improved pool queue plots in `webadmin` service

The pool queue plots in the `webadmin` service have been restructured
and are now easier to use.

#### Limited OpenID Connect support

An OpenID Connect plugin (`oidc`) for gPlazma was added as well as
limited support in the `webdav` service to accept OpenID Connect
bearer tokens. Separate documentation on how to make use of this will
be published later.

#### Generic gPlazma mapping plugin

A new generic mapping plugin (`multimap`) was added to gPlazma. It
allows mappings from any principal to multiple other
principals. Currently only dn, oidc, username, uid, gid, kerberos,
email principals are supported. An example configuration file looks
like

    "dn:/C=DE/O=Hamburg/OU=desy.de/CN=Kermit The Frog" username:kermit
    oidc:googleoidcsubject gid:1000,true uid:1000
    "dn:/C=DE/O=Hamburg/OU=desy.de/CN=Kermit The Frog" uid:1000
    "dn:/C=DE/O=Hamburg/OU=desy.de/CN=Kermit The Frog" uid:1000 gid:500,true gid:100


#### Cell address of the `info` service is no longer hard-coded in `httpd`

The new `httpd.service.info` property allows the cell address of the
`info` service to be configured in the `httpd` service. Sites with
custom `httpd.conf` definitions will have to update the configuration
such that the info alias looks something like

    set alias info class org.dcache.services.info.InfoHttpEngine -- -cell=${httpd.service.info}


#### NFS is better

Better spec compliance, faster.
