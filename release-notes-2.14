## Executive summary

Highlights from this release:

- Significant performance and storage space improvements in Chimera.

- Almost all certificiate handling code has been ported to the EMI
  CANL library rather than JGlobus. Provides OCSP support and
  EUGRIDPMA name space support.

- Concurrent request processing in gPlazma.

- Pool group patterns in admin shell.

- Improved UberFTP support.

- WebDAV door can report file locality.

- Fair share scheduling for SRM transfers.

- SRM database managed by liquibase.

- Configurable kXR_Qconfig support for xrootd.

## Incompatibilities

- Strict RFC 2818 host name checking in SRM/HTTP clients - this in
  particular affects server side srmCopy and WebDAV COPY. It is
  expected that this will break with server side copy to/from some
  WLCG sites. Globus Toolkit enables the same strict mode by default
  by the end of the year, so we expect the affected sites to get new
  host certificates soon. Additionally, server side copy is not used
  much, so it is likely not be a big issue for dCache.

- Significant schema changes in Chimera. Upon upgrade the schema will
  be updated, which may take a while for large sites. To downgrade,
  the schema changes have to be rolled back with the appropriate
  command in dCache *before* downgrading dCache.

- PnfsManager now uses a single request queue. This could possibly
  affected third-party monitoring scripts that scrape the info output.

- All forbidden and obsolete properties in 2.13 have been removed and
  all deprecated properties in 2.13 have been marked obsolete.

- RC4 ciphers are banned by default and the option to ban Diffie
  Hellman key exchange if broken has been removed.

- gPlazma now instantiates plugins separately for every use in
  gplazma.conf. This means that the configuration has to be specified
  for all lines, not just the first. This provides the flexibility to
  use the same plugin several times with different configurations.

- The WebDAV door enables BASIC authentication by default over HTTPS.

- Pools always compute checksums on the fly and the `ontransfer`
  checksum policy has been dropped.

- The SRM by default uses a fair share scheduler for scheduling
  transfers. Thus the observed behaviour under load may have changed.

- SRM 1 support is deprecated and disabled by default.

- SRM scheduler states have been simplified. Third party monitoring
  scripts that track request states may have to be updated.

- SRM no longer retries SRM requests internally. Failures are
  propagated to the client to provide fail-fast behaviour.

- SRM no longer resolves host names in SURLs when determining whether
  they are local to this dCache instance or not.  In particular, this
  may affect sites that use DNS aliases.

- The SRM database schema is now managed by liquibase and the schema
  is updated upon upgrade.  To downgrade, the schema changes have to
  be rolled back with the appropriate command in dCache *before*
  downgrading dCache. As a consequence, user information for existing
  SRM requests will be lost from the database. Third party scripts
  that access the SRM database directly may have to be updated.

## Release 2.14.25

### gplazma@-argus

Fixed a problem with the gPlazma argus plugin that caused it to fail with a ClassNotFoundException.

## Release 2.14.24

### alarms

A change to the alarms system improves handling of alarms with unset types.

### nfs

A race condition in the NFS door that could result in the creation of
multiple inconsistent copies of a file being uploaded has been fixed.

### pool

A regression was fixed that caused the `jtm go` command to occasionally not work.

When a transfer's status is queried before the transfer is initiated,
which can occasionally happen for queued requests, Exceptions were logged. 
This behaviour has now been corrected, providing more robust operation.

Several race conditions in the pool's migration module are fixed now.

A regression prevented queues to be set to not handle any jobs at all. The fix allows to pass a limit of 0 to `mover set max active`.

A regression was fixed that caused pools to "leak" movers if those were cancelled
while still being queued.

### spacemanager

Fixes a compatibility problem with NFS in which space manager would fail with
a duplicate key error.

### srm

A hint to describe the necessity to include escaping has been added.

The current release fixes issues in which the use of SRM third party copy operations could cause
the SRM cell to become unresponsive, possibly even run out of memory.

## Release 2.14.23

### admin

The admin door now generates SSH keys to ensure compatibility with OpenSSH 7. Additionally,
a new property `admin.paths.host-keys` was introduced in the admin.properties file, 
allowing to specify the location of keys.

### script

When a pool's metadata conversion operations would fail, an error caused
a script to report successful conversions. This error has been fixed now.

## Release 2.14.22

### admin

First observed on Ubuntu Xenial, dCache fails to install on modern 
Linux distributions due to the short key length of the SSH 1 keys 
generated in the post install script. This patch removes those keys
and their generation code. dCache has been supporting only modern 
key formats for quite some time now, so this change should not have
any impact on users.

### pool

When creating movers, some error conditions are expected to 
occur and dCache is designed to transparently recover from 
these. Consequently, this patch lowers the log level for the
related error messages to reflect that their causes are 
harmless.

Fixed a staging problem that would lead to failures in 
nearline COPY operations.

### srm

Some race conditions during SRM startup were fixed. Those race conditions
could potentially have lead to failures to expire jobs and to wrong job 
counts in the SRM schedulers.

### webdav

Until now, trying to access a file for which the client was not authorized
would generate a reply with a status code 200 OK, but an empty body, rather
than an error page. This patch corrects that behaviour and also improves
exception handling for that case.

## Release 2.14.21

### billing

The data used to create the 24 hour billing overviews is aggregated
in hourly intervals before creating the plots. However, if there is
very high activity on the system during an entire 24 hour period,
there have occasionally been timeouts when querying the database for
this aggregate data. This patch makes the data aggregation more robust
against such situations, resulting in lower latency for histogram
generation and no more timeouts.

### core

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is used to query status
information about certificates during authentication. dCache supports
this protocol, but relies on a functioning OCSP server for it to work
properly. This patch changes the default OCSP mode for dCache to IGNORE,
effectively disabling it, which is helpful for sites without a
working OCSP server in place.

### gplazma

Previously, attempts to authenticate users against an htpasswd entry
that was malformed resulted in a stack trace. This patch modifies
the error handling so that only a detailed error message
("Bad entry in file: hash does not start '$1$' or '$apr1$") is logged.

## Release 2.14.20

### Changes affecting multiple services

Fixed an issue with the dcache heap `dump command` when called with a simple file name as the output path. 
In this case the dump could in some cases be written to a different directory while the script claimed the dump had failed.
The dcache dump heap command has a `--force` option for cases in which the
JVM is unresponsive. This option was ignored for processes not running
as root.
This is fixed now.

### cells

Fixed a problem causing FTP and DCAP per connection instances to subscribe
to topics they should not subscribe to. This reduces overhead caused by
routing updates.

Fixes a problem during shutdown in which communication tunnels between
domains were shut down too early.

Fixed an issue that would cause log messages in which placeholders had
not been replaced with actual values.

A bouncing message bug in System cell is fixed.

### pnfsmanager

Setting atime-gap to -1 (default value) should disable file's last access time updates. 
Nevertheless, this was not the case and atime update was always enabled. 
This is fixed now and file's last access time can be disabled as described in the documentation.

### pool

Fixes an issue with pools becoming unresponsive in case of slow DNS reverse
lookups.

Fix race condition in request scheduler.

If FTP clients disconnect mid-transfer, pools log a DoorTransferFinished delivery failure as the door is gone.
This is fixed now and log messages like `Failed to deliver DoorTransferFinishedMessage message` are suppressed in pools.
When cancelling a job in a state that doesn't allow cancellation, an illegal
state exception is thrown. This was logged as a bug.
This is now fixed.

Pool to pool transfers are supposed to be cancellable, but was not working as the `HttpURLConnection` does not appear 
to react to thread interrupt. This could lead to migration job and rebalance job cancellation appearing to hang.
This is now fixed.

Fixes several performance regressions in pools that reduced mover creation rate
and could cause pools to become unresponsive due to lock contention.

### srm

Fixed a bug that caused delivery failures of credential service announcements
to be logged.
The `ls -completed=n` command has been observed to fail with
SRMInvalidRequestException.
This is fixed now and the 
output format of listing list requests has been changed to match that
of other requests.

## Release 2.14.19

### chimera

An internal database trigger was updated to insert data in the correct table, fixing a problem with the Enstore client.

When accessing a file for reading, the atime value must be updated. Previously, due to an error, the ctime (intended to reflect the time of changes to file attributes) was also changed. This update corrects that problem.

### http

In order to increase the performance of the Billing system, reverse DNS lookups were removed from the code. While this will result in IP addresses representing hosts in the billing file, DNS performance no longer impacts overall system performance.

### many

When representing checksums in the admin interface and configuration files, checksums are now presented in an improved format.

### pool

The nearline storage subsystem uses thread pools to manage its workload. Since some tasks are blocking, very high activity can cause these thread pools to grow beyond effective sizes. This may even lead to the pool becoming unresponsive.

This change introduces a new configuration property, "pool.limits.nearline-threads", which limits the thread pool size. The default value, 30, is chosen to be sufficient for almost all imaginable use cases while at the same time avoiding potential problems with resource exhaustion.

### srm

Due to a timing issue, an initial service announcement in the SRM was sent before any listeners could register for those announcements. Thus, upon startup, a delivery error would be logged. With this patch, sending of the initial message is delayed until after the registration of listeners, and the irrelevant error messages are avoided.

## Release 2.14.18

### doors

Fixes a bug in which a host name set in `*.net.listen properties` was not preserved
when publishing a door or generating SURLs.

### Changes affecting multiple services

When building rpm files a package `which` is now explicitly required as a dependency.

### cells

This change fixes a bug in routing manager that would leave orphaned topic routes in
dCache domain.

### pool

The nearline storage subsystem has a thread pool for various tasks. Some
of these tasks are blocking. Since the
thread pool is unlimited, a high inflow of new requests can cause the
thread pool to grow rapidly and even exceed thread limitations. In that
case the pool dies.
In the current release a new `pool.limits.nearline-threads` property is introduced 
which allow to limit the number of threads used by the nearline storage subsystem. Note that, the default is
30 threads.

## Release 2.14.17

### cells

LoginManager would occasionally generate error messages similar to "Discarding listening on $LOCATION 53684' because its age of 18721640 ms exceeds its time to live of 4500 ms.". This was due to erroneous reuse of old message envelopes in the internal messaging. This change fixes that problem.

This change addresses a potential problem in which messages sent between cells in the same domain could appear older than they are and thus would risk being discarded due to the time-to-live being expired.

Contains corrections to cells logging. The routing manager pinboard now shows information previously logged to various other cells.

### nfs

This change avoids ERR_PERM errors on NFS writes in situations where NFS doors do not receive redirect messages within the allowed timeframe. 

### pool

This patch avoids errors occuring when mover doors would not receive a start mover request within the allowed timeframe, providing more robustness on heavily loaded instances.

### srm

A Tier-1 site reported problems with a major WLCG VO's read requests. Investigating the source of the problems showed that the srm_ifce library, used by the (outdated) GFAL v1 and the (supported) GFAL v2 SRM libraries, drastically limits the permitted lifetime of requests without providing admins any way to configure this. 

For sites seeing errors related to desiredTotalRequestTime being exceeded, this change provides the new configuration option srm.request.maximum-client-assumed-bandwidth in srm.properties as a work-around. 

Sites not observing such errors do not need to change anything with regard to this value.

## Release 2.14.16

### chimera

Fix a regression causing directories to inherit ACLs as if they were files rather than directories. Soon we will provide a procedure to clean-up already existing wrongly inherited directories.

## Release 2.14.15

### ftp

On very short transfers, two internal messages could occasionally arrive in the wrong order. This would cause clients to see the "226 Transfer complete." message without the "150 Opening BINARY data connection for" immediate reply. This rare issue is now fixed.
### pnfsmanager

Billing entries for SRM uploads recently lost the storage class part of the entry. This update fixes that issue.
We observed an error caused by the parallel execution of two uploads, both trying to create the same (previously non-existing) directory). This modification fixes the underlying race condition, allowing such transfers to succeed.
### pool

Fixed a regression introduced in 2.13 in which internal options like -c:puts were erroneously included to the call out to the HSM script.
### poolmanager

This modification fixes a potential race condition in pool manager.

This modification fixes a race condition in pool manager that could theoretically have provided erroneous data to pin manager, space manager, srm, xrootd and webdav.
This modification fixes a race condition in pool manager that could theoretically have provided erroneous data to pin manager, space manager, srm, xrootd and webdav.
### scripts

The ctlcluster utility is now fully supported under Linux. 
### srm

When writing to a path /a/b/c, if b exists and is a file, SRM currently returns SRM_INTERNAL_ERROR. This modification changes that behaviour so that the more appropriate status SRM_INVALID_PATH is returned.
During SRM-based operations, some sites reported problems with the delegation of user credentials. This modification remedies those problems, while at the same time reducing the CPU usage of establishing 3rd-party SRM connections.
### webdav

This modification corrects the error reporting under WebDAV. When attempting to delete a non-existing file, unauthenticated users receive a 401 Unauthorized response, while authenticated users receive a 404 Not Found response.

## Release 2.14.13

### pnfsmanager

With this release, PnfsManager adds safety checks rejecting invalid upload paths that SRM might erroneously supply. This release hardens an installation against possible bugs triggering data loss.

This release adds a check that detects failed or incomplete SRM uploads and prevents the file from being committed to its final path. Common symptoms of this bug were zero sized files that experiment catalogues registered as successfully uploaded.

### pool

This patch improves support for HTTP Keep-Alive connections. On closing a connection, in accordance with RFC 2616, an HTTP header indicating closure of the connection is sent out.

On highly loaded systems, DNS slowdowns could lead to pools and/or domains becoming unresponsive. This fix increases resilience against DNS problems.

Increased performance and resilience in situations where NFS clients send many requests at once.

### srm

This release adds a check to detect broken uploads using SRM during the final stage of file transmission. While it causes transfers to take a little more time, resilience against upload failures is increased.

### webdav

dCache has supported 3rd-party HTTP push requests for WebDAV for some time. This release adds support for 3rd-party HTTP pull requests.

## Release 2.14.12

### Changes affecting multiple services

Several cases of slow performance were reported while deleting
directory in Chimera.  This is now fixed.

### pool

dCache `pool yaml` command dumps the meta data of a pool using the
human an machine readable YAML format.  A regression causing a null
pointer exception has been fixed.

When command execution to migrate files between pools (e.g. `migration
concurrency` or `migration copy`) is interrupted due to the failure to
find migration job the returned error message is considered as a bug.
This is now fixed so that a new message is returned indicating that
the job being requested does not exist.

### srm

When file upload is cancelled the value of temporary upload path
tracked by SRM could be a value different from a regular path, either
because it was changed outside of dCache, or it contains entries from
a very old version of dCache. This could result in data loss while
canceling upload.  The current release fixed a potential data loss
scenario.

### statistics

The statistics service creates static HTML pages that describe dCache
usage over time as simple files that the webadmin service can
serve. This includes information about pools and store-units.  The
problem is that the statistics webpages do not show information about
any pool or store-unit that contains a `/` in the name.  This is now
fixed.  A side-effect is that the history of any pool or store-unit
containing a `^` in the name is lost.

### xrootd

In XRootd Protocol Specification `kXR_dirlist` request is used to list
the contents of a directory. XRootd version 3.0.0 introduced the
`kXR_dstat` option to the `kXR_dirlist` command which returns stat
information for each entry.  The new release adds support for
`kXR_dstat` in dCache.  Note that for VOs that rely on token
authorization, this is a requirement for functional verbose listing.

## Release 2.14.11

### alarms

On heavily loaded systems creating alarms at very high frequencies and with comparatively slow databases for alarm logging, components ran out of memory and blocked. This release introduces a mechanism that will drop alarm messages that would cause the system to fail, ensuring continued operation. Note that no messages that are critical to system operation will ever be dropped by this change.

### nfs

Pinning files is now a non-blocking operation. For files stored on tape, this should result in a more responsive system behaviour, avoiding NFS blocking in situations with many concurrent pin requests.

## Release 2.14.10

### Changes affecting multiple services

Sometimes when a cell start up was interrupted an error message was logged as a bug. This is now fixed.  

### info-provider

The GLUE infomation provider supplies information about the dCache instance, which is important for the clients in WLCG area.
Because in dCache different doors can have different roots, clients may need to adjust their path when accessing dCache through different doors.
The info-provider is updated so that a new **path root**  property is provided.  This allows clients to modify paths, as necessary.  Note that
the SRM door already supports this translation when redirecting clients for transfers.

### pool

Transfers into or out of dCache that do not go through the client ("3rd-party transfers") may be
initiated through srm and webdav doors.  This release fixes allows `https` transfers without any
X.509 credential.

## Release 2.14.9

### nfs

This release includes the PNFS-ID in the door's logging output when
proxying data movement.

Fix infinite loop for a specific failure mode when writing data into
dCache: with this release, dCache will indicate a permanent error.

### spacemanager

Spacemanager backs off when it encounters a problem writing to the
database.  Previously, if the problem was due to deadlocks then the
two tasks involved are delayed by the same amount, which means it is
possible that subsequent attempt will also deadlock.  This release
randomises the delay to reduce the likelihood of this problem
occuring.

## Release 2.14.8

### pool

Fix buffer leak in the HTTP mover.

Improve scalability of pools when opening files or changing sticky
flags.

Resolve problem where starting a migration job on a pool with many
files can result in an unresponsive pool.

This release fixes a bug that caused the output of the `rep ls -s`
admin command to contain negative values.

Improve pool scalability of pool, allowing it to remain responsive
even when undertaking many pool-to-pool transfers.

### xrootd

The prevelance of old versions (3.x) of xrootd client along with that
version's unfortunate behaviour when replying asynchronously has
forced this release to revert the asychronous response to open
requests.

Fix dCache handling of open requests where uploads were considered
downloads.

## Release 2.14.7

### Changes affecting multiple services

Don't log `Error while reading from tunnel:
java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException` when a domain shuts
down.

### cleaner

Fix cleaner so it no longer sends cleaning requests to pools it knows
cannot enact these requests.  This prevents the cleaner from spamming
a disabled pool.

### pool

No longer spam log file with `666:"Client disconnected without closing
file."` when an xrootd client closes a file it was reading.  This is
still logged if the client fails to close a file opened for writing.

Improve pool startup time.

This release provides more robust monitoring of a pool's health by
periodically testing the data directory in addition to testing the
metadata.

With this release, the pool provides a more robust behaviour when the
client requests a file without being redirected from a door.  The pool
will redirect the client back to its previously used door, if known.
Additionally, the pool no longer logs when this happens in the pool
log file, but only in the pinboard.

This release fixes buffer leaks in the xrootd mover.  It also removes
`endsess` spam from pool log files.

The pool's `info` output now includes a progress report during
initialisation.

## Release 2.14.6

### Changes affecting multiple services

Update the Spring, Milton, AspectJ, Jetty and DataNucleus-core
libraries to latest version.  All dCache services are affected.

### gplazma

Fix debug logging of the `voms` gPlazma plugin so it shows a clear and
complete description of which FQAN is mapped; previously the log would
contain confusing entries if the first FQAN is not mapped exactly.

### pool

If a 3rd-party transfer fails then the pool may log and report
incomplete information on why this happened.  This release fixes this
problem.

On startup, a pool will scan its stored files and associated metadata
to ensure consistent and accurate information.  As this can take some
time, with this release the pool will log how long these scans take to
provide objective information when optimising this process.

### srm

This release fixes the interpretation of
`srm.persistence.enable.store-transient-state` when
`srm.persistence.enable.history` is disabled.  Sites that have history
disabled may put additional load on the SRM database if
store-transient-state is true; the old behaviour can be restored by
setting `srm.persistence.enable.store-transient-state` to false.

Fix the report sent to the srm client so that the failure code and
error message always match.  Earlier releases of this branch sometimes
returned an inconsistent combination of failure code and error
message.

Fix potential for inconsistent information being logged in the SRM
database, where the request state was different than the last logged
transition.

The SRM provides legacy support for SRM clients that require the TCP
connection to be closed without the orderly process that SSL/TLS
clients normally expect.  Unfortunately, this work-around contained a
bug where a client interaction can trigger an thread being caught in a
tight-loop, constantly consuming CPU.  This release fixes that
problem.

## Release 2.14.5

### Changes affecting multiple services

Enable SRM to discover FTP and dcap doors faster after restart.  May
also resolve messages like `Failed to deliver LoginBrokerInfoRequest
message <1449649391771:176> to ` `[>LoginBrokerRequestTopic@local]:
Route for >*@srm-bombayDomain< not found ` `at >dCacheDomain<`.  All
ftp and dcap doors should be updated.

Fix tab completion for non-default cells (messaging) topologies; all
domains must be upgraded to deploy the fix.  Sites with default
topologies are unaffected.

The doors that use TLS (SRM, gsi-dcap, gsi-ftp, gsi-xrootd) must
verify the user's certificate.  Previously this was both slow and
could only take advantage of a single core.  This release caches the
result for 5 minutes, ameliorating both problems.

For non-default star topologies, there are intermediate domains that
pass messages between dCacheDomain and end domains.  This release
fixes propagation of routing information by these intermediate
domains.  Sites with default topologies are unaffected; those with
non-default topologies should upgrade all intermediate domains.

### admin

When using the admin interface, there are three possible behaviours:
interactive mode (new interface), no-terminal mode (new interface
targeted for scripts) and legacy mode (old interface).  The latter two
could become stuck in an endless loop if the client disconnects before
all data was sent.  This is fixed with this release.

### gplazma

Fix how X.509 Distinguish Names (DNs) are handled.  This could cause
the x509 plugin to fail, logged as a `NoSuchMethodError` message.

### pool

Add new options to the `rep set sticky` command to allow filtering by
access-latency, retention-policy, storage class and cache class.

Add an option to migration module to support filtering by cache class.

Add the `-meta-only` option to migration module.  This limits the
affected replicas to those where the file's data is not transferred;
i.e., the target is some existing replica of the file.  Local replicas
that do not exist on any other pool are skipped.

Extend the migration module's `-sticky` option to allow negated
selection.  This is marked by prefixing the sticky owner with a `-`.
For example, `-sticky=-system` selects replicas that do not have the
`system` sticky.

Fix persistency of the sticky bits.  Should a replica's list of sticky
bits be modified by either the `rep set sticky` command or the
migration module modifying some existing replica then the sticky flags
are held in memory but not written to the Berkeley DB.  The next
restart of the pool will loose that information, potentially resulting
in data loss.  Pools that store metadata as files are not affected.

### poolmanager

Previous releases of dCache contained a bug where replicas generated
by pool-to-pool copies failed to include the access latency and
retention policy.  While not directly affecting dCache operations, the
result is that this information is no longer reliable.

### spacemanager

Fix listing by PNFS-ID.  Glob support is removed as it was
non-functional.

### srm

Allow SRM to start after it was shut down with `IN_PROGRESS` jobs.
Solves `Failed to restore job: Illegal state transition from
InProgress to Queued`.

Update migration procedure to remove obsolete states from the history
table.

### Changes affecting multiple services

The update to Chimera that came with 2.14 introduced a possible
deadlock.  These are clearly logged with `ERROR: deadlock detected` in
the domain log file, and occur when a file is both deleted and its
attributes are updated at nearly the same time.  This problem is fixed
with this release.  Domains hosting either the nfs door or the
pnfsmanager service should be upgraded.

Fix a problem in how cached values are updated within Chimera.
Domains hosting either an nfs door or the pnfsmanager service should
be upgraded.

A request to read a file stored only on tape when the user does not
have permission to stage files will fail.  Additionally, a user
attempting to upload a file that would trigger creating a new
space-reservation but the user is not authorised to create such a
reservation will also fail.  With earlier versions of dCache, in both
these cases, the door would retry the request until the times out.
This version fixes this issue.  All doors are affected.

This release fixes a caching issue where changes to inode metadata
(e.g., ownership or permissions) for `/` (the root directory of
Chimera) are not visible until the service is restarted.  This affects
NFS doors and pnfsmanager service.

Update Chimera so it does not trigger `DuplicateKeyException`, so
avoiding errors like `current transaction is aborted, commands ignored
until end of transaction block; nested exception` `is
org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: current transaction is
aborted, commands ignored until` `end of transaction block`.  Both NFS
doors and pnfsmanager are affected.  Sites that use PostgreSQL v9.5 or
later are encouraged to use the newer dCache driver:
`chimera.db.dialect = PgSQL95`.

### nfs

Fix the NFS door so it no longer logs `Post-processing failed: No such
file or directory` if a file is deleted while still open.

### pnfsmanager

Fix support for enstore.

Fix the Access Latency and Retention Policy of files when listing a
directory.

## Release 2.14.2

### pnfsmanager

Fix the error message (logged by the domain hosting pnfsmanager) if an
attempt to finalise an SRM upload fails within pnfsmanager, or if an
attempt to cancel an SRM upload fails within pnfsmanager.

### pool

Fix the NFS mover so that, when the client is reading a file and
reaches the end of file, the EOF flag is set correctly.  This bugfix
applies both to files read through pNFS and those read through the
door.

When a pool is initialising FTP-based third-party transfers, load all
trusted certificate authorities once rather than loading them on
demand.  This results in better performance over the lifetime of the
pool when transferring many files to remote servers with certificates
issued by different certificate authorities.

### poolmanager

When reporting an alarm that a pool is declared DOWN, the message
mistakenly omitted the name of the pool.  This is now fixed.

### webdav

Update to the latest version of milton.

### xrootd

Update the `alice-token` plugin to allow the host name check to
succeed on dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) machines.

Log initial response (usually that an asynchronous reply is
forthcoming) when client attempts to open a file.

Fix door so that it no longer logs: `An exceptionCaught() event was
fired, and it reached at the tail of the pipeline. It usually means
the`
`last handler in the pipeline did not handle the exception.`

## Release 2.14.1

### admin

Fix potential IndexOutOfBoundsException should the response from the
`acm` cell be malformed.

### alarms

Update the text format of logged and emailed alarms so that messages
include the type of alarm rather than simply the phrase `ALARM [
ALARM_TYPE ]`.  Note that the `alarms.email.encoding-pattern` and
`alarms.history.encoding-pattern` properties have been updated; sites
that have modified either of these properties must review their
configuration to take advantage of this update.

### pool

Fix an intended pool-to-pool transfer optimisation: the receiving pool
failed to reuse a delayed mover, should the pool-to-pool request
timeout and be retried.

## Release 2.14.0

#### Improved execution time statistics

Several cells provide information on request execution times. The code
has been improved to reduce the effect of numerical
instabilities. This improves the accuracy of the collected
statistics. Rather than the population standard deviation we now
report the sample standard deviation.

#### Use CANL for certificate verification

CANL is a library provided by EMI that provides support for OpenSSL
style trust stores, PEM encoded certificates, proxy certificates,
certificate path verification, CRL and OCSP validation, etc. In the
past, dCache has relied upon the JGlobus library for such operations,
but JGlobus has not seen much maintenance lately. We have switched to
using CANL instead as we feel it is more up to date (an important
aspect for security critical libraries), provides a cleaner API, has
more features, and doesn't lock us into old versions of other third
party libraries. There may also be performance benefits - we know for
certain that the startup time for client tools is improved, and time
will tell if the server side is faster too.

The amount of changes required in dCache to implement this was quite
large and touched most components, although the externally visible
number of changes should be low. Still, with this amount of changes
there is bound to be a regression or two.

One feature of JGlobus missing in CANL is an implementation of the GSI
protocol. GSI is essentially TLS with an additional credential
delegation step after the initial TLS handshake. In dCache 2.13 we
introduced our own GSI implementation in dCache to provide support for
non-blocking IO in the SRM door. In 2.14 this has been adopted by all
doors providing GSI support, i.e. SRM, FTP and DCAP. Furthermore, the
client side of GSI has been implemented and is used by our FTP and SRM
clients, as well as our GridSite delegation shell.

As part of porting DCAP and FTP to our own GSI implementation, the SSL
context is now cached between sessions, greatly reducing the
per-connection overhead of these doors. Consequently these doors now
expose settings for key pair cache lifetime:

    #  ---- Delegation key pair reuse lifetime
    #
    #  X.509 clients may delegate credentials to dCache using GSI or the dedicated GridSite
    #  delegation service. The delegation works by the server generating a certificate
    #  signing request which the client signs. Since generating a key pair as part of the
    #  signing request is expensive, dCache caches and reuses the key pair.
    #
    #  This setting controls for how long a key pair is reused. A compromised key could be used
    #  for new signing requests for this amount of time. If the reuse time is too short, the
    #  overhead of generating new key pairs increases.
    #
    dcache.authn.gsi.delegation.cache.lifetime = 30000
    dcache.authn.gsi.delegation.cache.lifetime.unit = MILLISECONDS


The default host and CA certificate refresh periods have been
significantly reduced to 60 seconds:


    # ---- Host certificate refresh period
    #
    # This option influences in which intervals the host certificate will be
    # reloaded on a running door.
    #
    dcache.authn.hostcert.refresh = 60
    dcache.authn.hostcert.refresh.unit = SECONDS
    
    # ---- CA certificates refresh period
    #
    # Grid-based authentication usually requires to load a set of
    # certificates that are accepted as certificate authorities. This
    # option influences in which interval these trust anchors are
    # reloaded.
    #
    dcache.authn.capath.refresh = 60
    dcache.authn.capath.refresh.unit = SECONDS
    


Since CANL provides configurable name space verification, CRL
validation, and OCSP validation, all doors and pools relying on TLS
now respect the following new configuration properties:

    # ---- Certificate Authority Namespace usage mode
    #
    # A CA namespace restricts the certificates dCache accepts as issued by a given CA. The namespace
    # is defined in .namespaces (EURGIDPMA) or .signing_policy (GLOBUS) files alongside the CA certificate.
    #
    # This setting controls the rules governing the verification of these namespaces. The following
    # documentation is copied from the EMI CANL library used by dCache.
    #
    #       GLOBUS_EUGRIDPMA
    #
    #          A Globus EACL is checked first. If found for the issuing CA then it is used and enforced.
    #             If not found then EuGridPMA namespaces definition is searched. If found for the issuing CA
    #                then it is enforced.
    #                   If no definition is present then namespaces check is considered to be passed.
    #

    #
    #          A Globus EACL is checked only. If found for the issuing CA then it is used and enforced.

    #
    #       EUGRIDPMA
    #
    #          An EuGridPMA namespaces definition is checked only. If found for the issuing CA then it is enforced.
    #             If no definition is present then namespaces check is considered to be passed.
    #
    #       GLOBUS_EUGRIDPMA_REQUIRE
    #

    #             If not found then EuGridPMA namespaces definition is searched. If found for the issuing CA
    #                then it is enforced.
    #                   If no definition is present then namespaces check is considered to be failed.
    #
    #       EUGRIDPMA_GLOBUS_REQUIRE
    #
    #          An EuGridPMA namespaces definition is checked first. If found for the issuing CA then it is enforced.
    #             If not found then Globus EACL definition is searched. If found for the issuing CA
    #                then it is enforced.
    #                   If no definition is present then namespaces check is considered to be failed.
    #
    #       GLOBUS_REQUIRE
    #
    #          A Globus EACL is checked only. If found for the issuing CA then it is used and enforced.

    #             If no definition is present then namespaces check is considered to be failed.
    #
    #       IGNORE
    #
    #          CA namespaces are fully ignored, even if present.
    #
    dcache.authn.namespace-mode=EUGRIDPMA_AND_GLOBUS_REQUIRE
    
    # ---- Certificate Revocation List usage mode
    #
    # CAs regularly publish certificate revocation lists (CRLs) containing the serial id of
    # certificates that have been revoked. Such certificates should not be accepted by dCache.
    #
    # Such CRLs are stored in .r? files alongside the CA certificate. It is outside the scope
    # of dCache to refresh the CRLs.
    #
    # This setting controls how dCache makes use of such CRLs. The following documentation is copied
    # from the EMI CANL library used by dCache.
    #
    #       REQUIRE
    #
    #          A CRL for CA which issued a certificate being validated
    #             must be present and valid and the certificate must not be on the list.
    #
    #       IF_VALID
    #
    #          If a CRL for CA which issued a certificate being validated
    #             is present and valid then the certificate must not be listed on the CRL.
    #                If the CRL is present but it is outdated (or anyhow else corrupted) then the validation fails.
    #                   If CRL is missing then validation is successful.
    #
    #       IGNORE
    #
    #          CRL is not checked even if it exists.
    #
    dcache.authn.crl-mode=REQUIRE
    
    # ---- On-line Certificate Status Protocol usage mode
    #
    # On-line Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative to CRLs in which
    # dCache consults an external service to check the validity of a particular certificate.
    #
    # This setting controls how dCache makes use of this protocol. The following documentation is copied
    # from the EMI CANL library used by dCache.
    #
    #       REQUIRE
    #
    #          Require, for each checked certificate, that at least one valid OCSP responder is defined and
    #             that at least one responder of those defined returns a correct certificate status.
    #                If all OCSP responders return error or unknown status, the last one received is treated as a
    #                   critical validation error.
    #                      Not suggested, unless it is guaranteed that well configured responder(s) is(are) defined
    #                         and can handle all queries without timeouts.
    #
    #       IF_AVAILABLE
    #
    #          Use OCSP for each certificate if a responder is available. OCSP 'unknown' status and
    #             query errors (as timeout) do not cause the validation to fail.
    #                Also a lack of defined responder doesn't cause the validation to fail.
    #
    #       IGNORE
    #

    #
    dcache.authn.ocsp-mode=IF_AVAILABLE


Finally, logging from CANL is different. Our initial impression is also that it is
significantly better.

#### FTP Client

Another area in which dCache relied on the JGlobus client was for the
FTP client. An FTP client is needed as part of our SRM client as well
as for SRM and WebDAV third party copy. In the quest to drop the
JGlobus dependency, we have forked the JGlobus FTP client and ported
it to CANL. There should be minimal user visible changes from
this. The most interesting may be that our client now identifies
itself to the server as being dCache and using the dCache version
number.

#### SRM client

As mentioned above, the SRM client has been updated to use our own GSI
implementation on top of CANL for certificate handling. On a host with
a large number of CA certificates, the startup time is significantly
reduced.

The SRM protocol is implemented using SOAP over HTTP over GSI. Due to
the old SOAP version used we are bound to the Axis 1 library. In the
past we relied upon the minimalistic HTTP client integrated into Axis
1. In dCache 2.14 we added an Axis handler to use the Apache HTTP
components client. The primary benefits are:

- Proper keep-alive support, meaning that the client no longer needs
to reestablish the connection to the server for every low level SRM
request. This both reduces the latency experienced by the client and
reduces load on the server.

- Strict RFC 2818 host name verification.

In partiular the latter point has the potential to break compatibility
with some sites. This is the case if the host certificate used by the
site does not comply with RFC 2818. Without strict RFC 2818 support,
TLS/GSI connections are susceptible to man in the middle attacks. The
Globus Toolkit (the C library, not the JGlobus Java version) will
switch to strict RFC 2818 support by default at the end of 2015 and we
expect that most sites will quickly request certificates with correct
subject alternative names.

If compatibility with non-compliant sites is required, we recommend
using a version of the SRM client prior to 2.14. On the server side,
strict RFC 2818 host name verification is only used for server side
srmCopy or WEBDAV copy. If these are needed with non-compilant sites,
we suggest using dCache 2.13.


#### Updated help pages for many admin shell commands

dCache has for several years been in a transition between two
infrastructures for providing admin shell commands. The newer of these
provides much better help pages. In dCache 2.14 many commands have
been ported from old to the new scheme.


#### Admin shell gains pool group globs

The new admin shell introduced in dCache 2.13 provides bulk commands
with cell name globs. In dCache 2.14 pool group globs have been added
to these commands. A pool group glob follows the pattern
`pool/poolgroup`, with either side accepting `?` and `*` wildcards. It
expands to all pools that match the left side of the pattern and which
are within a pool group matching the right side. Either side may be
empty and is equivalent to `*`.

Thus `/` will match any pool that appears in any pool group,
`/atlas_disk` matches any pool in `atlas_disk`, and
`*_rack1/atlas_buffer` matches any pool with a name ending in `_rack1`
in the `atlas_buffer` pool group. These could for instance be used to
perform bulk commands over a set of pool:

    \s /atlas_tape flush set interval 600
    \s /atlas_tape save


#### Significant schema changes in Chimera

The Chimera database schema has been updated to improve throughput,
reduce latency and reduce disk space. It will be updated automatically
the first time the PnfsManager is started, but is is advisable to
apply the schema changes ahead of time by using the `dcache database
update` command. It is also advisable to make a backup of the database
prior to upgrading as well as run a test migration on a clone of the
database to know how long it will take as well discover any
incompatibilities with local schema modification.

Once upgraded to dCache 2.14, one cannot downgrade to 2.13 without
rolling back the schema changes. This must be done *before*
downgrading using the `dcach database rollbackToDate` command.


Several schema changes are applied durin upgrade:

- The `.` and `..` directory entries are no longer stored in the
  database.  Since Chimera is stored in a relational database, it can
  find parrent directories without these backpointers. Where
  applicable, these directories entries are created on the fly in
  dCache.

- Directory tags are no longer created by a trigger. In the past the
  trigger reacted upon the insertion of the `..` entry, but since we
  no longer insert this entry we cannot rely on this
  trigger. Furthermore, for the temporary directories created for
  every SRM upload the tags should not be copied and the trigger
  needlessly slowed down creating such directories.

- Inodes are now created using the new `f_create_inode` stored
  procedure. This eliminates several round trips between the client
  and PostgreSQL.

- The type of the `itagid` column of the `t_tags_inodes` table has
  been changed to a 64 bit auto sequence field. This reduces storage
  space as well as CPU load for these tables.

- The t_access_latency and t_retention_policy tables have been merged
  into the t_inodes table. The former two tables are dropped. This
  reduces storage space as well as latency in creating and reading
  inodes.

- The address mask is removed from the `t_acl`. Chimera ACLs no longer
  support access control by client IP.

#### Chimera PostgreSQL 9.5 driver

Chimera has pluggable RDBMS drivers. dCache 2.14 adds a driver
specific for PostgreSQL 9.5 and newer. This driver avoids the
excessive logging caused by primary key uniqueness violations that are
common with Chimera.

To activate, set `chimera.db.dialect` to `PgSQL95`.

#### Chimera race conditions and performance improvements

Many rare races and sublte bugs have been fixed, and lots of small
performance improvements have been made.


#### PnfsManager uses single request queue

Due to the extensive changes in Chimera, PnfsManager can now use a
single request queue shared between all threads. Thus the `info`
output no longer shows a queue per thread and it is easier to keep all
threads busy.

Technically, there is a queue per thread-group, but since
thread-groups are not currently used by Chimera, for all intends and
purposes there is only one general request queue.


#### Forbidden and obsolete properties have been dropped

Properties marked as forbidden or obsolete in 2.13 have been removed
from dCache 2.14. Properties marked deprecated in 2.13 have been
marked obsolete. Please verify and fix any warnings produced by
`dcache check-config` *before* upgrading.

#### Cryptographic cipher selection

dCache now bans RC4 ciphers by default. The ability to disable Diffie
Hellman key exchange on JVMs in which this is broken has been removed
since Diffie Hellman now works on all supported JVMs.

#### FTP gains new SITE commands

The FTP door now supports the `SITE CHGRP`, `SITE SYMLINKFROM` and
`SITE SYMLINKTO` non-standard commands to change the file group and
create symbolic links. These commands are supported by the UberFTP
client.


#### FTP proxy limits internal network interface

FTP doors may act as proxies for the data connection. In this case the
pool establishes a TCP connection to the door. Previously the door
would listen to the wildcard address (i.e. all interfaces) even though
only one specific address was sent to the pool to connect to. In
dCache 2.14 the door now limits the server socket to this one address.


#### gPlazma drops support for plugin caching

gPlazma used to only instantiate a plugin once even if it was mentioned
several times in gplazma.conf. This meant that only a single configuration
could be applied, thus making several usecases impossible to handle.

dCache now instantiates every plugin every time it is referenced in
gplazma.conf and each instance can have its own configuration. The
options for forcing enabling the old behaviour have been removed.

#### gPlazma supports concurrent request processing

In the past gPlazma was single threaded, which in particular was a
problem with plugins that called out to external services. gPlazma is
now multi-threaded and will happily call several plugins
concurrently. Even the same plugin may be called concurrently, which
means that all plugins - including those by third-parties - must be
thread safe.

#### gPlazma XACML plugin update for improved spec compliance

The XACML plugin has been ported to CANL too and in the process it
was updated to improved compliance with the specification. The client
library used by the plugin unfortunately depends on JGlobus and thus
the current version of dCache still ships with JGlobus.

#### DCAP delegates X.509 and VOMS proxy processing to gPlazma

Previously DCAP would validate the VOMS signatures of a proxy in the
door, thus requiring a vomsdir to be set up on the door. gPlazma now
delegates this to gPlazma and the gPlazma voms plugin. Thus it is no
longer necessary to keep a vomsdir setup on GSIDCAP doors.


#### NFS door publish exported paths login broker information

The NFS door now include the exported paths as part of the login
broker information. This information is available to the info service
and the srm door.

#### NFS door sees large number of fixes and improvements

As always, the NFS door has received a fair share of fixes and
improvements. If you rely heavily on the NFS door, using the latest
version of dCache is recommended.


#### Pool manager generates sorted configuration files

Previously entries where output in hash order, which meant that minor
changes in configuration could cause drastic changes to the order.


#### WebDAV door links to https version of dCache home page

Thanks to a contribution by Christoph Anton Mitterer, the footer on
WebDAV door directory listings now point to the https version of the
dCache home page.


#### WebDAV door can report file locality

SRM has the concept of file locality, i.e. whether a file is on disk,
on tape, both, offline or lost. The WebDAV door now exposes this
information too:

- The HTML rendering of directory listings uses the icon to indicate the
  file locality.

- For programatic access, the WebDAV PROPFIND method.

An example of the latter follows:

    $ curl -X PROPFIND -H Depth:0 http://localhost:2880/disk/test-1447231167-1 \
      --data '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
              <D:propfind xmlns:D="DAV:">

#### WebDAV door provides human-friendly file sizes

An abbreviated file size is shown as a hint in the WebDAV door HTML
rendering. To see, however the mouse over the file entry.

#### WebDAV door enables BASIC authentication by default over https connections

This provides a means for clients without a certificate to
authenticate with the server. Note that BASIC authentication should
not be used over unencrypted connections.

#### Pools now always compute checksums on the fly

Recently we changes the default checksum policy for new pools from
`onwrite` to `ontransfer`. The latter requires less resources as it
computes the checksum during the upload rather than reading the file
back from disk after the transfer.

In dCache 2.14 the `ontransfer` checksum calculation is no longer
optional - it is always computed for streaming uploads. The `onwrite`
policy can still be enabled, but it would calculate the checksum a
second time. A future update of dCache will remove the `onwrite`
policy.

#### SRM database schema changes

The SRM database is now managed by the liquibase schema management
library. An existing schema from a previous installation is
automatically detected, but we recommend doing a test upgrade on a
clone of the database to check compatibility with any local schema
modifications.

Several changes are made to the schema of the SRM database:

- Missing indexes are added.

- Unused indexes are removed.

- The `count` column of the `lsrequests` table is renamed to `cnt` to avoid
  conflicts with the like named SQL keyword.

- The encoding of user information is redone entirely and user information is
  now stored in a binary format.

In particular the latter change is worth paying attention to. Due to
this change, existing requsts will fail during upgrade as the existing
user information is deleted upon upgrade. Already finished requests
will be kept in the database until they are garbage collected, but
they too loose all information about who created it. Furthermore, the
binary encoding in the new user record means that it is no longer easy
to access this information in local queries. This change was necessary
to work around limitations in the previous serialization - in short,
we cannot serialize X.500 names in string form without loosing
information.

#### SRM gains a pluggable transfer strategy mechanism

Plugins may decide in which order to serve transfer requests by
clients. Two strategies are shipped with dCache with the default
implementing a simple fair share strategy:

    # ---- Request transfer strategy
    #
    # srmPrepareToPut and srmPrepareToGet requests enter the READY state when the TURL is handed
    # out to the client. If the request is processed asynchronously (client is polling for the result),
    # the request stays in the RQUEUED state until the client queries the result.
    #
    # A transfer strategy plugin has the ability to prevent the transition from the RQUEUED to READY
    # state. A plugin may allow the number of concurrent transfers to be limited, or may provide
    # some fair-share between parties.
    #
    # Two plugins ship with dCache:
    #
    #     first-come-first-served
    #
    #         The maximum number of requests in the READY state is limited by
    #         srm.request.*.max-transfers, but otherwise TURLs are handed out to
    #         whomever comes first.
    #
    #     fair-share
    #
    #         The maximum number of requests in the READY state is limited by
    #         srm.request.*.max-transfers, but slots are kept free such that each party with
    #         requests in RQUEUED will receive its fair share.
    #
    #           A configurable discriminator defines the grouping between which to provide a
    #           fair share.
    #
    srm.plugins.transfer = fair-share
    
    # Discriminator for the fair share transfer strategy.
    srm.transfer.fair-share!discriminator = ${srm.plugins.discriminator}

    

#### Deprecation of SRM 1 support

The SRM 1 protocol has long been superseeded by the SRM 2.2
protocol. dCache 2.14 adds options to disable SRM 1 support and
disables it by default:

    #
    # SRM versions to support.
    #
    # Comma separated list of SRM versions to support.
    #
    (any-of?1|2)srm.version=2

You can reenable SRM 1 support by adding it to the above configuration
option. Please contact us if you do so we can ascertain when to drop
SRM 1 entirely.

This change also removes support for third party srmCopy to/from SRM 1
servers, no matter whether SRM 1 support in the server is enabled or
not.

#### SRM request scheduler state simplification

SRM scheduler states have been simplified by collapsing several states
into the new `InProgress` state. Besides changing the output of the
`info` command, this will change the state values observed in the
database. Sites that monitor these states will have to update their
monitoring scripts. The job state mappings can be viewed here:
https://github.com/dCache/dcache/blob/master/modules/srm-server/src/main/resources/org/dcache/srm/request/sql/srmjobstate-214.csv



#### SRM no longer retries requests

SRM used to have support to retry requests internally upon errors. The
implementation of this functionality was problematic since

- many errors were not retried even when they should, and worse

- many errors that should not be retried were.

In the interest of fail fast behaviour and simpler code, support for
internally retrying requests has been dropped. Failures are propagated
to the client and it is up to the client to determine whether and how
to retry. This also allows client to more quickly fall back to other
sites in case of problems.

#### SRM changes algorithm to detect a local SURL

The SRM protocol has a concept of site URLs and classifies these into
those local to the storage system and those belonging to other storage
systems. This classification is important when the SRM is to determine
which file is local and which is remote in a third party SRM copy
operation, or just to determine if the SURL is indeed local in put or
get operations.

The most important changes are:

- srmCopy is now limited to having a local source or local destination
  SURL. It no longer allows a transfer between a local non-SRM door and
  a remote system.

- no DNS lookup is performed in determining whether the SURL is
  local. Previously the host name would be resolved to an IP addressed
  and the IP addressed would be compared to local addresses. Now the
  list of local host names is determined during startup and the host
  name in the SURL is compared to the local names directly. An
  administrator still has control over which names to consider local
  by setting the `srm.net.local-hosts` property.


#### Several minor SRM fixes

Several corner cases and race conditions have been fixed, as well as
better failure handling to prevent leaking pins or upload directories.



#### Configurable kXR_Qconfig replies for xrootd

The xrootd protocol has a mechanism to query the server configuration
using a kXR_Qconfig request. dCache provided a few hard-coded
properties, but the xrootd protocol specifies an open list of
properties.

In dCache 2.14 the admin may inject additional properties to be
returned to the client. These are configured through the dCache
configuration system:

    #  ----- Custom kXR_Qconfig responses
    #
    #   xrootd clients may query the server configuration using a kXR_Qconfig request.
    #   These key value pairs can be queried. Additional key value pairs may be added as
    #   needed, see the xrootd protocol specification at http://xrootd.org/ for details.
    #
    (prefix)xrootd.query-config = kXR_Qconfig responses
    xrootd.query-config!version = dCache ${dcache.version}
    xrootd.query-config!sitename = ${dcache.description}
    xrootd.query-config!role = none
    
    #  ----- Custom kXR_Qconfig responses
    #
    #   xrootd clients may query the server configuration using a kXR_Qconfig request.
    #   These key value pairs can be queried. Additional key value pairs may be added as
    #   needed, see the xrootd protocol specification at http://xrootd.org/ for details.
    #
    (prefix)pool.mover.xrootd.query-config = kXR_Qconfig responses
    pool.mover.xrootd.query-config!version = dCache ${dcache.version}
    pool.mover.xrootd.query-config!sitename = ${dcache.description}
    pool.mover.xrootd.query-config!role = none
    


#### Many third party libraries have been updated

Most notably the new version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver has some
nice performance improvements.
