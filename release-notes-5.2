<h1>What's new in dCache 5.2<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- As a Golden Release, the focus of 5.2 is on robustness and stability. Many small changes (not all mentioned here) target handling rare error conditions, and
logging has become more detailed across the board.

- XRootD third-party copying support has matured, including credential delegation support, and can be used in production.

- This release introduces the new concept of "zones" to improve networking performance in geographically distributed dCache instances. While 5.2 does not offer
  a full, admin-configurable system yet, this is an important milestone for future installation types.


## Incompatibilities

- The order in which fields are logged in the frontend log for WebDAV accesses has changed (but the set of fields itself has remained the same). This may require
  tuning of any custom log processors that rely on the field ordering.
  
- The default setting for logging aborted FTP transfers was changed, so that sites upgrading to dCache v5.2 will now automatically log aborted
transfers.

- Pool tags may no longer use the literal string "zone".

## Release 5.2.8

### frontend

The current release fixed QoS pin semantics.

A bug is fixed in frontend that results in a NullPointerException for
billing queries where no limit is specified.

### srm

Investigation into tape carousel has highlighted limitations in what
dCache logs. In particular, information about the pin lifetime for
srmBringOnline is missing.

This is now fixed and dCache SRM access logging contains information about client's desired
pin lifetime in srmBringOnline requests.

### xrootd

The current release  refined error handling by providing  more meaningful (or at least consistent) error responses
to the client.

## Release 5.2.7

### Changes affecting multiple services

The Apache Commons Compress library used in dCache was updated to version 1.19.

A rare deadlock situation in the Chimera database was eliminated. In cases
where, within the same directory, concurrent mkdir and rmdir events happened,
transactions within the database could deadlock. This would be indicated by the message

    ERROR: deadlock detected

in the logs.

### pool

A regression introduced in the last release caused a ClassNotFoundException on pool startup
with a message like

    [ERROR] Server responded with an error: [3012] Failed to open file (Protocol Xrootd-4.0:123.32.123.32:38374 is not supported [27])
    
appearing in the logs. This release fixes that issue.

There were reports of extraordinarily high CPU usage on pool nodes with a large
number of cached files. Through an optimization of the `sweeper`, CPU usage
was reduced significantly.

### xrootd

This release fixes a small regression in the `kill mover` command that 
would occasionally fail to kill all targeted movers.

This release fixes a vulnerability in dCache's XRootD protocol implementation. 
We recommend that all sites update their XRootD doors.
Details will be made available through EGI Security and, in a week's time, through an
update to these release notes.

## Release 5.2.5

### chimera

Admins may require to change top-level tags in the middle of a
directory tree and those tags should be propagated to all subdirectories.
To support this a recursive update tag command is required.

Admins now  can `set/update` and push directory tags as:

````

`chimera:/# writetag /exports/data foo-tag foo`
`chimera:/# pushtag /exports/data foo-tag`

### nfs

The current release added ability to set file checksum(s) via dot command.

### pool

The current releasse improved metadata check speed on pool re-start. 

### resilience

If there was two replicas, one of which was precious,
and some change was triggered which reduces the required count
for the file to 1, the removal operation was failing. This behavior is now fixed. 

### srm

A new user community requires the srm tools to be able to handle
very large file listings. During preliminary tests, OutOfMemory
errors from the srmls tool were observed. This is now fixed and 
srm can now support operations on very large file lists
without running out of memory.

### webdav

The current release added allow header to list of response headers for OPTION method
request.

### frontend

Admins may now configure frontend to specify in which country (or
countries) data may be stored. This information is visible through
dCacheView.

### gplazma

The current release fixe remote reading of JSON with UTF-8 CharSet and dCache can now work with OPs that use `utf-8` charset.

### nfs

The current release added  ability to get valid checksum types via NFS.
Usage  `cat ".(checksums)()"`. Returns a new-line delimited list of checksum type names.

### util

The current release improved log messaging so that CDC context is available in during retries.

## Release 5.2.3

### nfs

NPE on "show transfers" command is now fixed.

### webdav

The current release fixed CORS for WebDAV doors that do not allow anonymous
access; in particular, to support dCacheView uploading
and downloading files with such authentication-required
WebDAV doors.

## Release 5.2.2

### chimera

The shell infrastructure supports commands being given interactively, on
the commandline (e.g., 'chimera mkdir /path/to/dir') and from stdin
(e.g., 'echo "mkdir /path/to/dir" | chimera'). `chimera` now supports the latter
case and properly shows command output when invoked in that fashion. 

### frontend

This release updates dCache View to 1.5.5.

### nfs

The NFS door now correctly handles situations where newly created read-only
files could occasionally not be written into:

    f = os.open('test.txt', os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREAT, 0400)
    os.write(f,"Hello pNFS!")
    os.fsync(f)
    os.close(f)

will now succeed.

### webdav

A client may issue a PUT request that targets an existing collection
resource; i.e., attempt to write a file as a path that is a directory.
dCache, until now, responded with an incorrect status code of 500. This release
changes the status code for this operation to 405 (Method not allowed), 
thus keeping closer to RFC 4918.

### xrootd

This release improves compatibility with the xrdcp client in versions \>4.9
by responding correctly to query strings requesting a specific checksum type.

## Release 5.2.1

### frontend

dCache View was updated to version 1.5.4.

### ftp

This release fixes a regression that would cause erroneous NullPointerExceptions when FTP doors were probed by HAProxy.

### many

The `dcache pool ls` command now provides correct output even if the pool is
defined with a single-digit number of bytes. 

### pool

The default value for the xrootd Third-Party Copying server response 
timeout, `pool.mover.xrootd.tpc-server-response-timeout`, was 
increased from 2 to 30 seconds to provide more robust behaviour 
in the face of high loads and network congestion.

### transfermanager

Error messages where the TransferManager is unable to discover the
current status of the pool mover now include the pool's name.

### xrootd

This release fixes an issue that would cause high CPU load on xrootd.

TPC lite (delegation) is now more robust when communicating with EOS destinations.

XRootD doors now correctly communicate their TPC capabilities to clients.

## Release 5.2.0

### Admin

The interactive admin shell gained two improvements in logging: Log entries from admin commands now include the SSH session-ID,
and commands that were executed through the admin shell are logged in detail. An example: 

    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:49:58.518+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.connect remote.socket=/2001:638:700:xx:52224
    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:49:58.561+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.login username=admin remote.socket=/2001:638:7xx:52224 method="PublicKey (RSA SHA256:al9RPdXETJXX)" successful=true
    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:50:06.657+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.exec username=admin cmd.args="\\c PoolManager"
    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:50:12.000+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.exec username=admin cmd.destination=[>PoolManager@core-dcache-lab] cmd.args="rc ls"

### Alarms

The alarms system gained some improvements in logging, such as reporting the originating pool name in `POOL_DEAD` messages.
Additionally, messages can be sent directly to Kafka. The new properties `dcache.log.kafka.topic`, for setting the topic
name, and `dcache.log.level.kafka` to set the log level, were added to configure this feature.

### Billing

The database tables `billinginfo`, `storageinfo`, `doorinfo` and `hitinfo`
can, if desired, be automatically truncated. This allows a logrotate-style
approach to limiting the growth of the billing database, which
can fill up quickly over the course of time if there is a lot of
door activity.

A built-in cron can be set to run every 24 hours in order to remove
older rows from these "fine-grained" tables.

The following properties are relevant:

    billing.enable.db-truncate (default = false)
    billing.db.fine-grained-truncate-before (default = 365)
    billing.db.fine-grained-truncate-before.unit (default = DAYS)

### Chimera

The Chimera database now keeps track of the time when a file was added to the trash table. This timestamp
is stored in the `ictime` field of `t_locationinfo_trash`.

### Cleaner

The cleaner now can wait a specified amount of time after deletion before file finally get removed from pools
and HSM. Two new properties were added to control this behaviour:

    cleaner.service.grace-period = 0
    cleaner.service.grace-period.unit = SECONDS

### Frontend

The HTTP access log now includes HTTP Entities (if they were present in the request) to facilitate debugging.

Additionally, the frontend now provides useful, minimal logging of API requests in the access log file.

Periodic activity associated with the frontend door is now logged with the
door's cell name.  Such messages will also appear in the door's pinboard.

### FTP

The default settings for the logging of aborted FTP transfers were changed, so that Sites that upgrade to dCache v5.2 will now automatically log aborted
transfers. The reason for that change is that it provides post mortem information about
transfers where the client received less data than it requested. Enabling it only after someone reports a problem could be too late (if the
problem is not reproducible).

The log entries for aborted transfers now also include detailed information about the cause of the issue, as well as being more compact.

### gplazma

As for several other services, logging was improved to make troubleshooting easier. Failed login attempts using OpenID-Connect, particularly from dCacheView, are now logged.

### Info

The info service now list a domain's zone as the metric
'domains.*domain-name*.static.zone', if the domain is configured to have
a zone.  If the domain is not configured with a zone then this metric is
not published.

### NFS

When a pNFS client using the `flexfile` layout reports a connection error to a pool, then, as an alternative to just logging the issue, an alarm will be raised.

Periodic activity associated with the NFS door is now logged with the
door's cell name.  Such messages will also appear in the door's pinboard.

### Pool

The timeout for XRootD 3rd-party-copying responses was increased to 30 seconds, making operations more robust.

Pool start-up logging is now recorded against the corresponding pool cell name.

A pool now includes a 'zone' tag where the value is zone within which
the pool resides.  Pools no longer accept the tag 'zone'.

Various internal changes should make pool operations in general more robust.

### Pool Manager

In a situations, where for a given READ access two links are available and there are no pools available at
link with a higher priority, then a pool from a lower link priority will be selected if file is available.

### Resilience

Resilience is now able to use a CACHEd file as a replication source in cases where no STICKY copy is available.
This also means that a cached initial copy (such as
if a resilient pool is marked lfs=volatile and
is chosen by the pool manager) will not stop
resilience from creating the requisite number of
permanent copies.

Various other changes make Resilience's operations more robust.

### Transfer Manager

Error messages where the TransferManager is unable to discover the
current status of the pool mover now include the pool's name.

An optimization to retrying mover operations makes Transfer Manager's operations more efficient: 
If a pool does not support a particular transfer type, retries on that pool will not even be attempted.

### WebDAV

Periodic activity associated with the WebDAV door is now logged with the
door's cell name.  Such messages will also appear in the door's pinboard.

### XRootD

The client timeout is now configurable through two new properties or, alternatively, an interactive admin command.

The Third-party embedded client has a timer which will interrupt and return
an error if the response from the server does not arrive after a given
amount of time.

The default values for this can be controlled by the properties:

    pool.mover.xrootd.tpc-server-response-timeout
    pool.mover.xrootd.tpc-server-response-timeout.unit

These are set to 2 seconds iby default, matching the comparatively aggressive behavior of the SLAC
implementation.  However, dCache allows you to control this dynamically
as well, using the admin command

    \s <xrootd-door> xrootd set server response timeout

This could conceivably be necessary under heavier load.

### Zookeeper

The Zookeeper library was updated to version 3.4.14, addressing CVE-2019-0201.

### Changelog from 5.1.0 to 5.2.0
