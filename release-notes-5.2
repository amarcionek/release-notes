<h1>What's new in dCache 5.2<br/>
<small>Release notes</small></h1>
</div>

## Highlights

- As a Golden Release, the focus of 5.2 is on robustness and stability. Many small changes (not all mentioned here) target handling rare error conditions, and
logging has become more detailed across the board.

- This release introduces the new concept of "zones" to improve networking performance in geographically distributed dCache instances. While 5.2 does not offer
  a full, admin-configurable system yet, this is an important milestone for future installation types.


## Incompatibilities

- The order in which fields are logged in the frontend log for WebDAV accesses has changed (but the set of fields itself has remained the same). This may require
  tuning of any custom log processors that rely on the field ordering.
  
- The default setting for logging aborted FTP transfers was changed, so that sites upgrading to dCache v5.2 will now automatically log aborted
transfers.

- Pool tags may no longer use the literal string "zone".

## Release 5.2.0

### Admin

The interactive admin shell gained two improvements in logging: Log entries from admin commands now include the SSH session-ID,
and commands that were executed through the admin shell are logged in detail. An example: 

    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:49:58.518+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.connect remote.socket=/2001:638:700:xx:52224
    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:49:58.561+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.login username=admin remote.socket=/2001:638:7xx:52224 method="PublicKey (RSA SHA256:al9RPdXETJXX)" successful=true
    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:50:06.657+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.exec username=admin cmd.args="\\c PoolManager"
    level=INFO ts=2019-05-02T12:50:12.000+0200 event=org.dcache.services.ssh2.exec username=admin cmd.destination=[>PoolManager@core-dcache-lab] cmd.args="rc ls"

### Alarms

The alarms system gained some improvements in logging, such as reporting the originating pool name in `POOL_DEAD` messages.
Additionally, messages can be sent directly to Kafka. The new properties `dcache.log.kafka.topic`, for setting the topic
name, and `dcache.log.level.kafka` to set the log level, were added to configure this feature.

### Billing

The database tables `billinginfo`, `storageinfo`, `doorinfo` and `hitinfo`
can, if desired, be automatically truncated. This allows a logrotate-style
approach to limiting the growth of the billing database, which
can fill up quickly over the course of time if there is a lot of
door activity.

A built-in cron can be set to run every 24 hours in order to remove
older rows from these "fine-grained" tables.

The following properties are relevant:

    billing.enable.db-truncate (default = false)
    billing.db.fine-grained-truncate-before (default = 365)
    billing.db.fine-grained-truncate-before.unit (default = DAYS)

### Chimera

The Chimera database now keeps track of the time when a file was added to the trash table. This timestamp
is stored in the `ictime` field of `t_locationinfo_trash`.

### Cleaner

The cleaner now can wait a specified amount of time after deletion before file finally get removed from pools
and HSM. Two new properties were added to control this behaviour:

    cleaner.service.grace-period = 0
    cleaner.service.grace-period.unit = SECONDS

### Frontend

The HTTP access log now includes HTTP Entities (if they were present in the request) to facilitate debugging.

Additionally, the frontend now provides useful, minimal logging of API requests in the access log file.

Periodic activity associated with the frontend door is now logged with the
door's cell name.  Such messages will also appear in the door's pinboard.

### FTP

The default settings for the logging of aborted FTP transfers were changed, so that Sites that upgrade to dCache v5.2 will now automatically log aborted
transfers. The reason for that change is that it provides post mortem information about
transfers where the client received less data than it requested. Enabling it only after someone reports a problem could be too late (if the
problem is not reproducible).

The log entries for aborted transfers now also include detailed information about the cause of the issue, as well as being more compact.

### gplazma

As for several other services, logging was improved to make troubleshooting easier. Failed login attempts using OpenID-Connect, particularly from dCacheView, are now logged.

### Info

The info service now list a domain's zone as the metric
'domains.*domain-name*.static.zone', if the domain is configured to have
a zone.  If the domain is not configured with a zone then this metric is
not published.

### NFS

When a pNFS client using the `flexfile` layout reports a connection error to a pool, then, as an alternative to just logging the issue, an alarm will be raised.

Periodic activity associated with the NFS door is now logged with the
door's cell name.  Such messages will also appear in the door's pinboard.

### Pool

The timeout for XRootD 3rd-party-copying responses was increased to 30 seconds, making operations more robust.

Pool start-up logging is now recorded against the corresponding pool cell name.

A pool now includes a 'zone' tag where the value is zone within which
the pool resides.  Pools no longer accept the tag 'zone'.

Various internal changes should make pool operations in general more robust.

### Pool Manager

In a situations, where for a given READ access two links are available and there are no pools available at
link with a higher priority, then a pool from a lower link priority will be selected if file is available.

### Resilience

Resilience is now able to use a CACHEd file as a replication source in cases where no STICKY copy is available.
This also means that a cached initial copy (such as
if a resilient pool is marked lfs=volatile and
is chosen by the pool manager) will not stop
resilience from creating the requisite number of
permanent copies.

Various other changes make Resilience's operations more robust.

### Transfer Manager

Error messages where the TransferManager is unable to discover the
current status of the pool mover now include the pool's name.

An optimization to retrying mover operations makes Transfer Manager's operations more efficient: 
If a pool does not support a particular transfer type, retries on that pool will not even be attempted.

### WebDAV

Periodic activity associated with the WebDAV door is now logged with the
door's cell name.  Such messages will also appear in the door's pinboard.

### XRootD

The client timeout is now configurable through two new properties or, alternatively, an interactive admin command.

The Third-party embedded client has a timer which will interrupt and return
an error if the response from the server does not arrive after a given
amount of time.

The default values for this can be controlled by the properties:

    pool.mover.xrootd.tpc-server-response-timeout
    pool.mover.xrootd.tpc-server-response-timeout.unit

These are set to 2 seconds iby default, matching the comparatively aggressive behavior of the SLAC
implementation.  However, dCache allows you to control this dynamically
as well, using the admin command

    \s <xrootd-door> xrootd set server response timeout

This could conceivably be necessary under heavier load.

### Zookeeper

The Zookeeper library was updated to version 3.4.14, addressing CVE-2019-0201.
